It keeps the phone cool , however you can absolutely do light gaming on it ... performance is very stable and it doesn't throttle at all .THE CAMERA is good it takes sharp and detailed images in good conditions and even in low lights the shots are decent ... The colour science on all the 3 cameras (excluding the macro lens) is very consistent . Shots taken are good , portrait mode has decent edge detection . Pictures are vivid and punchy coloured (as expected from SAMSUNG tuning)... Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .THE BATTERY is big changes grade , you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me . The charging is capped to 25w but you have to buy the charger separately... but charging speed is fine . No complains on that .THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (₹18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone ."", 'The package came with a tear just big enough to pull out the box from within. I was suspicious but the seal on the box was intact and seemed untouched. So I accepted it.The phone functions smoothly and the colors are crisp. It feels bulky though. Battery easily lasts for a day on a single charge. I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.', ""Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens."", ""Best if you get this in 13499 and go for Samsung original charger cost around 1000 it charge phone in very less time as compared to any normal charger and best cover is spign essential kit you'll get it for 599 something or only spign sand blast cover cost 700CONCLUSION:- I AM SURE YOU HAVE WATCHED REVIEW OF THIS PHONE DONT THINK MUCH PURCHASE IF GETTING FOR 13500 BECAUSE ACCESORIES WILL MAKE WHOLE FIGURE 15000 OR MORE SOMETIME HOPE IT HELP"", 'Cellulare molto bello .', 'Good Products', 'Pros,It is unlocked  and working in Saudi Arabia, Good display, large battery, good sound, best phone for the price, NFC working in KSACons,Weight and bulky, taking 2hr to full charge because large battery and 25w charging, no water/dust protection.Finally :  worth for the price,', 'Highly recommended', 'Es un Samsung, ya con eso poco queda ya por decir, lo compré para mi madre, elegí éste modelo porque podía ponerle el modo sencillo ,solo con lo más básico, y le va bien, pero Samsung debería pensar más en las personas con problemas de audición y tener un modo para ello, el volumen podría ser más alto, he tenido que descargarle una aplicación para ponerle los tonos de llamada más alto, por lo demás, llegó en perfectas condiciones, se ve la calidad y la batería dura mucho.']",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.3234285714285714,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nt-RGKpyL._SX679_.jpg

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money.

It has Android 15 and future updates too. I played bgmi for 2 hours to test the phone. No lag. I read comments of lag and observed they all had 6GB version, and 8GB people gave 5 star comments, no lag etc. So I went with 8GB. I suggest you to do the same. Now the price is reduced too.It has punch hole camera which comes with premium versions. 5G is working great in both sims. Speaker is also loud and clear. I am satisfied with my purchase.

Not too bad.UI - too much bloatware, pre-install app were there. Which is very irritating.Over all this phone is very much good.

If you're a mobile gamer, especially into BGMI, this phone is a solid pick.Performance & Gaming:The phone supports 90 FPS in BGMI, delivering a buttery smooth gameplay experience with minimal to no gyroscope delay.I recommend playing at 60 FPS for more consistent frame rates throughout long sessions.With Turbo Mode enabled, you can enjoy 85–90 FPS for around 1 to 1.5 hours, after which it gradually dips to 65–75 FPS, but the overall performance remains stable and fluid.Design:The design is striking, especially the yellow and black striped variant, which gives it a sporty and premium feel.The fingerprint scanner is responsive and unlocks the phone swiftly.Battery:Battery life is moderate. On Smooth + Extreme+ settings, the phone consumes about 15% battery per hour of gameplay.This usage is reasonable considering the performance output and FPS level.Connectivity:5G performance is reliable and strong with both Jio and Airtel networks, offering fast and stable connectivity.In the Box:You get a 45W fast charger, a transparent protective case, and a SIM ejector tool — all essential accessories included right in the package.Verdict:The Narzo 70 Turbo is a fantastic choice for gamers and power users on a budget.

Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed.

Battery easily lasts for a day on a single charge. I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.', ""Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed.

If you're a mobile gamer, especially into BGMI, this phone is a solid pick.Performance & Gaming:The phone supports 90 FPS in BGMI, delivering a buttery smooth gameplay experience with minimal to no gyroscope delay.I recommend playing at 60 FPS for more consistent frame rates throughout long sessions.With Turbo Mode enabled, you can enjoy 85–90 FPS for around 1 to 1.5 hours, after which it gradually dips to 65–75 FPS, but the overall performance remains stable and fluid.Design:The design is striking, especially the yellow and black striped variant, which gives it a sporty and premium feel.The fingerprint scanner is responsive and unlocks the phone swiftly.Battery:Battery life is moderate. On Smooth + Extreme+ settings, the phone consumes about 15% battery per hour of gameplay.This usage is reasonable considering the performance output and FPS level.Connectivity:5G performance is reliable and strong with both Jio and Airtel networks, offering fast and stable connectivity.In the Box:You get a 45W fast charger, a transparent protective case, and a SIM ejector tool — all essential accessories included right in the package.Verdict:The Narzo 70 Turbo is a fantastic choice for gamers and power users on a budget.

No complains on that .THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (₹18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone ."", 'The package came with a tear just big enough to pull out the box from within. I was suspicious but the seal on the box was intact and seemed untouched. So I accepted it.The phone functions smoothly and the colors are crisp. It feels bulky though. Battery easily lasts for a day on a single charge. I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.', ""Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens."", ""Best if you get this in 13499 and go for Samsung original charger cost around 1000 it charge phone in very less time as compared to any normal charger and best cover is spign essential kit you'll get it for 599 something or only spign sand blast cover cost 700CONCLUSION:- I AM SURE YOU HAVE WATCHED REVIEW OF THIS PHONE DONT THINK MUCH PURCHASE IF GETTING FOR 13500 BECAUSE ACCESORIES WILL MAKE WHOLE FIGURE 15000 OR MORE SOMETIME HOPE IT HELP"", 'Cellulare molto bello .', 'Good Products', 'Very good seller and good quality device... i recommended this seller', 'Highly recommended', 'Es un Samsung, ya con eso poco queda ya por decir, lo compré para mi madre, elegí éste modelo porque podía ponerle el modo sencillo ,solo con lo más básico, y le va bien, pero Samsung debería pensar más en las personas con problemas de audición y tener un modo para ello, el volumen podría ser más alto, he tenido que descargarle una aplicación para ponerle los tonos de llamada más alto, por lo demás, llegó en perfectas condiciones, se ve la calidad y la batería dura mucho.']",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.3234285714285714,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PlVwPxFRL._SX679_.jpg

The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.On top of that, the phone doesn’t have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.The camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected.

It fluctuates a lot when u do a rush gameplay minimum it goes 50fps. And average 70-80 fps.  But constant at 60fps.

Display is also very goodSound - a average setup with sound in this loud but some beat missing it feels like. But still 14k price segment Good enough.Camera - is very decent not too good. Not too bad.UI - too much bloatware, pre-install app were there. Which is very irritating.Over all this phone is very much good.

If you're a mobile gamer, especially into BGMI, this phone is a solid pick.Performance & Gaming:The phone supports 90 FPS in BGMI, delivering a buttery smooth gameplay experience with minimal to no gyroscope delay.I recommend playing at 60 FPS for more consistent frame rates throughout long sessions.With Turbo Mode enabled, you can enjoy 85–90 FPS for around 1 to 1.5 hours, after which it gradually dips to 65–75 FPS, but the overall performance remains stable and fluid.Design:The design is striking, especially the yellow and black striped variant, which gives it a sporty and premium feel.The fingerprint scanner is responsive and unlocks the phone swiftly.Battery:Battery life is moderate. On Smooth + Extreme+ settings, the phone consumes about 15% battery per hour of gameplay.This usage is reasonable considering the performance output and FPS level.Connectivity:5G performance is reliable and strong with both Jio and Airtel networks, offering fast and stable connectivity.In the Box:You get a 45W fast charger, a transparent protective case, and a SIM ejector tool — all essential accessories included right in the package.Verdict:The Narzo 70 Turbo is a fantastic choice for gamers and power users on a budget.

Nach ausgiebiger Nutzung kann ich sagen, dass dieser Stylus einfach fantastisch ist und seine Versprechen in jeder Hinsicht erfüllt. Hier ist meine ausführliche Bewertung.### **Design & Haptik – Hochwertig und ergonomisch**Der **Apple Pencil Pro** sieht nicht nur elegant aus, sondern fühlt sich auch hervorragend in der Hand an. Der **matte, rutschfeste Griff** sorgt dafür, dass er auch bei längeren Sessions angenehm zu halten ist. Das Gewicht ist perfekt ausbalanciert und gibt dem Stift eine hochwertige Haptik, die bei vielen anderen Stylus-Geräten fehlt. Der **magnetische Anschluss** an das iPad ist ebenfalls eine praktische Funktion, da er nicht nur zur Aufbewahrung dient, sondern auch für das **kabellose Aufladen**. Das Design ist schlicht und edel – genau, wie man es von Apple erwartet.### **Präzision & Performance – Pixelgenaue Genauigkeit**Was den Apple Pencil Pro auszeichnet, ist seine **außergewöhnliche Präzision**. Bei der Arbeit mit **grafischen Design-Apps** oder beim Erstellen von **digitale Kunst** kann man millimetergenaue Linien und Details zeichnen, die mit anderen Stiften einfach nicht möglich wären. Die **Latenz ist nahezu nicht vorhanden** – jeder Strich wird sofort umgesetzt, was das Zeichnen unglaublich flüssig und natürlich macht.Die **Neigungs- und Drucksensitivität** des Pencils ist ebenfalls bemerkenswert. Man kann die Strichstärke und Intensität ganz einfach steuern, je nachdem, wie fest oder in welchem Winkel man den Stift hält. Das gibt einem als Künstler oder Designer ein unglaubliches Maß an Kontrolle. Die **Drucksensitivität** funktioniert perfekt und lässt sich präzise anpassen – je nach Anwendung, ob du feinste Details zeichnen oder breite Striche ziehen möchtest, alles lässt sich exakt steuern.### **Nutzung im Alltag – Ideal für Notizen und mehr**Neben dem Zeichnen ist der **Apple Pencil Pro** auch hervorragend zum **Notizenmachen** geeignet. Auf dem iPad lässt sich handschriftlicher Text genauso schnell und flüssig aufschreiben wie mit einem traditionellen Stift auf Papier. Durch die hohe Präzision kann man sogar kleine Details oder Zeichnungen direkt in seine Notizen integrieren, was das Arbeiten und Lernen deutlich vereinfacht. Die **Integration in Apps** wie Notability, GoodNotes und Procreate funktioniert nahtlos, was den Arbeitsfluss extrem vereinfacht.### **Langlebigkeit & Akku – Überragend**Der **Akku des Apple Pencil Pro** ist großartig. Ich kann mehrere Tage mit einer einzigen Ladung arbeiten, selbst bei intensiver Nutzung.

However, Amazon insists on a DOA letter from the service center. When I asked Motorola for this document, they outright refused, saying they don’t issue DOA letters and that the Service Delivery Note should suffice.This back-and-forth between Amazon and Motorola has left me stranded with a faulty device and no resolution. I’ve wasted days, energy, and ₹25,000 for a product that doesn’t work and for support that is completely incompetent and dismissive.My Expectations:Amazon: Stop pushing customers to service centers for defective devices. Accept the Service Delivery Note and replace the product immediately.Motorola: If your service center acknowledges the issue, issue a DOA letter or collaborate with Amazon for resolution.Both companies: Improve your post-purchase customer support processes.

There\'s a brief learning curve learning all the functions that the small number of overloaded buttons perform, but I think that after a few uses, I\'ll hardly give it a thought. You do have to download the DJI app to take advantage of most of the features - that was no issue other than on first install, it went into ""sleep"" mode and said to tap the screen to wake it up... tapping would do nothing, but restarting the freshly-installed app seems to have fixed that little mishap. I also had to look-up which button to press to re-center it. The motors aren\'t super powerful, so just make sure you\'ve mounted your phone in the center... and that the phone is oriented correctly in the harness (camera to the correct side). I use it with an iPhone 16 Pro. The phone\'s built-in magnet mount wasn\'t strong enough, but the mount included with the DJI is plenty powerful. At first, I didn\'t think the mount would fit my phone, but with a little spring-force, it fits just fine (But I can\'t imagine it fitting on the 16 Pro Max???) It also fits with my one-sided case attached... just got to fully extend it and give it a little effort. I was also concerned the mount was going to be pressing the side buttons, but somehow it does not.The stabilization is amazing. The tracking is amazing. The thumb-joystick is cool. The ability to power zoom while recording is next-to-amazing (on the iPhone 16 Pro there\'s a tiny hiccup when it switches between the lenses, but it works better than I would have expected).I didn\'t really even know this product existed until an hour before I bought it. I was just shopping for a cheap phone tripod/holder and a hand-grip... this product obviously gives a TON more than those two items for about the same price! (Unless you\'re comparing it to the cheapest grips).If it continues to perform as my first day tests... I can\'t give it a high enough recommendation for anyone who wants their phone video to truly step up to near-professional results.I can\'t wait to show this at our next Photography Club meeting!UPDATE: I gave it a more thorough work-out the next day and my amazement only grew!

It is 2021 model with stock Android 12 (not upgradable OTA anymore).I was always planned to use a gimbal, but last year I finally tried. Started with Osmo Mobile 3. I really liked it, but it has two major flaws:1. The grip was almost impossible to fit. I am using Otter case which makes the phone very wide. It is still (barely) within 84 mm spec of the Osmo 3, but the design of the grip makes it very hard to set, always touches the power button and if moved away - unbalances the gimbal.2. The axis movement - I am not sure how's possible DJI as a company selling drones to design such a totally counter-intuitive axis joystick control! I am not a pilot, but have used many RC controllers and am an old gamer – when you pull the rudder (joystick) – you expect to get your nose up and vise versa… well – it’s the OPPOSITE! Same as horizontal controls. There were numerous threads with users begging DJI to correct the SW to include simple axis inversion, but all in vain for Osmo 3!Those were the reasons I sold it and decided to try Osmo Mobile 7 with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 + Plus.Well – well worth the switch!So far all is good:– grip is very strong and the shape of jaws is much better, not overlapping the power button and at the same time very strong!- axis inversion – yippee (!!!)  - finally, I can actually control the gimble!- so far, all the functions, menus and features seem to work as intended on the gimbal and the phone- absolutely no delay or glitching in any mode, including 4K video.In short – I am very satisfied with the product and its backward compatibility with old hardware and software!Good job, DJI!""]",General Satisfaction & Overall Experience,0.3,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iywJZXGNL._SX679_.jpg

The vegan leather finish gives it a premium feel that rivals phones in the ₹10,000-20,000 range. The weight distribution is well-balanced - not too heavy, not too light - which is impressive considering the large battery capacity. The overall build quality feels solid and reliable.Display ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (9.5/10)The display is arguably the phone's strongest feature. At this price point, you simply won't find better display quality anywhere else. The screen delivers excellent clarity and vibrant colors that enhance the overall user experience significantly.Performance ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (7/10)Performance is the phone's main weakness, though this is expected at the entry-level price point. The device experiences occasional lag and hanging, particularly during multitasking or demanding operations. While it's not the fastest phone available, it's still the best performer you'll find in this specific price category.Gaming PerformanceLight games: Run smoothly without issuesFree Fire: Works well on smooth and standard settings, but struggles on high/extreme settingsBGMI & CODM: Unplayable due to performance limitationsCasual games (like Candy Crush): Work perfectly fineBattery Life ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (9/10)Battery performance is exceptional with no complaints. The large battery capacity ensures all-day usage for typical smartphone activities. However, the included charger is only 10W despite the phone supporting up to 18W fast charging.Audio Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (10/10)The Dolby Atmos dual speaker system is a standout feature that you won't find in competing phones at this price point. The audio quality is impressive and adds significant value to the overall package.Camera Performance ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (7.5/10)The camera system delivers decent results for the price range. While not groundbreaking, it captures acceptable photos for everyday use and social media sharing.Software & FeaturesSoftware Experience: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (8.5/10)Gestures & Features: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (9/10)Fingerprint & Face Lock: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (8/10)Network Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (8/10) - Good call quality, but limited due being only 4G.What's in the BoxThe company includes thoughtful accessories:Charging adapter (10W, though phone supports 18W)High-quality transparent protective caseStandard documentation and cablesWho Should Buy This Phone?✅ Perfect For:Parents or elderly users who primarily use WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and light appsSecondary phone usersBudget-conscious buyers prioritizing design and display qualityUsers who enjoy media consumption (thanks to the excellent speakers and display)❌ Not Recommended For:Primary smartphone users with demanding needsHeavy gamers looking to play graphics-intensive gamesUsers requiring fast performance for multitaskingThose heavily dependent on 5G connectivityFinal VerdictThis phone excels in design, display, audio, and battery life while struggling with performance. It's an excellent choice for users with basic smartphone needs or as a secondary device.

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far.

I haven’t even opened the box because I already know it won’t work with a UAE SIM without going through extra steps.Amazon should clearly state this kind of restriction, especially for customers outside India.

They have given the responsibility of valuing the old mobile to their delivery boy. Now the delivery boys have become king and always find out unnecessarily small,  artificial defects in the mobile so that your valuation is decreased by 50%, then they will ask for BRIBE openly like Rs.500 or 1000 to assign the higher valuation! I have seen it happen with dozens of my friends and colleagues who were too naive to fall for Fraudkart's schemes.Hence, I always give old mobiles to Amazon in exchange for new ones, AMAZON DELIVERY GUYS NEVER TRIED TO DEFRAUD ME IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. I behave like a responsible customer and declare the genuine condition of the Mobile beforehand such as scratches on screen, body cracks etc. and the delivery guys accept it without any arguments. KUDOS TO AMAZON for such a transparent process!About the Mobile:I have a OnePlus 11 but was too tensed about it especially while getting millions of calls and messages everyday so I decided to buy a secondary mobile which could be abused without any guilt. BTW I just realised that I always had a mobile with AMOLED screen right since the early days when I bought the Galaxy S2 when it was launched! I never ever bought one with a LCD screen ever and this Iqoo Z9 Lite is the first one and I don't hate it as much as I hoped I would.Display quality is far better than cheap LCD mobiles and 90 Hz frequency is an icing on the cake. Since it's a 720p resolution, I can see the pixelated texts if I look closely but that's an exception, normally I don't mind the lower resolution in day to day life. I wish the max brightness was higher but hey, it's a budget mobile so you can't get everything in it!Do note that this mobile HAS ONLY 1 SINGLE MICROPHONE at the bottom, no additional mics for noise cancellation at our end. I am pretty sure I will hear complaints from the call receiver when I am in a crowded place with lots of background noise.The OS is pretty smooth and fast but quite laggy in comparison to a OnePlus Nord or Redmi HyperOS.Conclusion: I could not find a better deal for my requirements so I bought this mobile but others should definitely explore other options if they are going to buy it as their one & only mobile."", 'Super', 'Nice experience but improvement need camera', 'Good', 'The product is amazing at this price.one of the feature which I like is camera quality.']","Camera, Performance & Display",0.35,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619VJYWIbXL._SX679_.jpg

It fluctuates a lot when u do a rush gameplay minimum it goes 50fps. And average 70-80 fps.  But constant at 60fps.

Not too bad.UI - too much bloatware, pre-install app were there. Which is very irritating.Over all this phone is very much good. If u r a gamer and ur budget is very low  approx 15k then this phone is for you. Grab it and enjoy it.Recommended - buy 8gb and 128gb if u  have more budget then go for some other brand.

If you're a mobile gamer, especially into BGMI, this phone is a solid pick.Performance & Gaming:The phone supports 90 FPS in BGMI, delivering a buttery smooth gameplay experience with minimal to no gyroscope delay.I recommend playing at 60 FPS for more consistent frame rates throughout long sessions.With Turbo Mode enabled, you can enjoy 85–90 FPS for around 1 to 1.5 hours, after which it gradually dips to 65–75 FPS, but the overall performance remains stable and fluid.Design:The design is striking, especially the yellow and black striped variant, which gives it a sporty and premium feel.The fingerprint scanner is responsive and unlocks the phone swiftly.Battery:Battery life is moderate. On Smooth + Extreme+ settings, the phone consumes about 15% battery per hour of gameplay.This usage is reasonable considering the performance output and FPS level.Connectivity:5G performance is reliable and strong with both Jio and Airtel networks, offering fast and stable connectivity.In the Box:You get a 45W fast charger, a transparent protective case, and a SIM ejector tool — all essential accessories included right in the package.Verdict:The Narzo 70 Turbo is a fantastic choice for gamers and power users on a budget.

The battery life is abysmal, lasting only a few hours with minimal usage. The rear camera quality is also very bad, capturing fake colors that don't reflect real-life scenes. To make matters worse, the phone gets significantly slower after software updates, making it frustrating to use. Additionally, the 5G signal reception is very weak, making it difficult to stay connected. The software also lags and freezes frequently, making it difficult to perform even basic tasks. Furthermore, I was surprised to find that the phone doesn't come with a charger in the box, which is a basic accessory that should be included. The in-display fingerprint sensor is also unreliable, failing to recognize my fingerprint sometimes. The single speaker is another major letdown, producing low-quality sound that's not loud enough. But what's even more shocking is that the front camera produces completely fake and unnatural images, making it useless for selfies or video calls.

It's stock Android without any bloatware.2. If your data is backed up on Google, it syncs and downloads smoothly.3. Once set up, it gives instant response to app usage, including banking and finance apps, Amazon, ticket booking apps, etc. My phone use now saves me so much time because of the fast response.4. The charger adapter is just over 20W so perfect for Type C fast charging, and the cable is heavy duty braided. Fast charging time, and I'm getting about a day and a half with normal use, and there's usually around 30% left at the end of a day of a lot of use. Of course, the phone is new, and I'm sure this will change as it gets older.5. The 65 MP camera features both various auto as well as manual modes, and while I'm not fussy about photos, I'm very happy with the landscape and skyscape photos I've taken at different times of the day, including in the evening. I haven't yet tried night photos.6. There are several utility features like a compass, which I actually use.7. The keyboard software is intuitive and responds well to sweep typing which I extensively use.8. Some Android features like YouTube Music, Google One, etc. you can uninstall if you don't need them and want to save space.9. The gel phone case works fine for me and fits well like for any stock Android phone.10. Since I only use a bluetooth speaker or headphones, the sounds and volume controls have been fine for me.11. Note - the fingerprint sensor is on the side - right side, third button down, but if you include for both hands, it actually works easier if you use your free hand for fingerprint unlocking, so I prefer this to the back-located sensor.12. The phone is dual SIM, but note that SIM1 is nano, but SIM2 is micro, so you want to make sure you keep your SIM adapters.13. Storage - this was really the only negative - with so many good features, it was rather odd that SIM2 slot is also the storage slot, but only for TF cards, not micro SD cards. Since these are not interchangeable, you have to invest in a TF card which is old school compared to SD cards, and it also means you can't use two SIMs and a storage card. Since I will be using two SIMs in the future, I just have to make sure that I'm not using my phone as a basic storage unit and backing up my data esp photos and videos on the cloud. I prefer a fast response to storing a lot of media. So, I prefer to create things for social media on my computer and transfer via cloud so I can use it on my phone.14. Weightwise, the phone is about 200g, so about an average Nokia weight. I've already dropped it twice by mistake, and am relieved to find it continues fine, but it's much better to be careful with the phone.15. Screen visuality is good, and since I use backed up display and phone settings which I downloaded to my phone, the phone looks exactly like how I want it to. That's up to you to configure - the phone has great wallpapers, themes, and a very wide range of ring and notification tones, so you can discard what you don't want.I think it's been the best phone buy I've made till now, and I usually never say I love my phone - I'm saying it now, and I'm very happy with the value for money I've received. If your use and style is similar to mine, you may really enjoy the phone."", ""On paper the product is good but in real it doesn't not fullfill the requirements as specified camera is worst, having a phone but we can't click a photo,the camera app automatically closes if you click photo and photo are also not saved in gallery. After many attempts of the photo is clicked than the picture quality is very poor, it provides photos as jio phone or any other 2mp camera phone.Phone is hanging alot in 1 week use as it seems it has been used for many years.I requested for replacement a technician was alloted and he said replacement will be done but it has been 5 days but I am receiving any response.The worst experience I have been using this phone.It only looks good,in hand it feels good but from inside it is worst why companies make such worst phone I don't understand.The Acer has broken my trust, it could not do better in mobile industry."", ""Bought this phone for Rs 11999.Package does not include a charger, so keep that in mind.>>DESIGN: 7/10Nothing special, Great Acer design with 3 vertically stacked cameras.Display bezels are a bit thicker than the competition, but they are uniform on all sides.Plastic back does not look good, no matter which color you choose, but a back cover solves that problem.>>DISPLAY: 10/10The best part about this device is the display, FDH+ super with punchy colors and great viewing angles. Samsung finally moved on from outdated U-shaped notches and brought a punch hole.If you like viewing content, then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.>>SOUND: 9/10Dual speakers with Great sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.Sound is crisp, loud and clear.>>SOFTWARE: 10/10Another great aspect of this device. Well designed ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is not present, at a low price device which makes it really more useable.>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from Acer, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 400k and real-life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer, for me the performance is more than enough. no lags, no stutters and no app crashes.Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.>>CAMERA : 7.5/10One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.50 MP main camera has clicks great photos with typical Acer colors and great details.2 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses easily. OIS is not available in camera, videos, but the EIS works well.>>BATTERY : 9/10Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Fast Charging 33 watt charger that acer gives with the device, it takes 1.2 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.>>VERDICT:Finally a great budget phone from Acer that actually performs well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of Acer and Google safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot."", ""The Acer's newly launched model is no less than it's peers. I have been using this for a month or so and it stacked up great. Definitely recommend.Pros and Cons- Clean bloatware free UI, makes the phone fast and switching between apps is of no issue. Did not hang once.- Crisp Call quality with loud speakers.- Back Camera is Good but front camera is average and below par in low light.- Display quality of 120Hz is fine, but didn't use much in 120Hz though. 60Hz is fine for everyday usage.- Battery lasts for 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy.- Charging time is 45 mins from 15% to 85%, which is a bit slow.- Useful pre loaded gestures from Acer.- No heating issues as of now.- The phone feels a bit heavy.Overall great phone given the budget and its competitors.""]",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.2428118420741371,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tZWQnP4dL._SX679_.jpg

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far. Did not see the phone over heating issue.Samsung has produced a quality product. I would definitely recommend this. It’s a good buy.', 'This is the worst product I have ever used from samsung.The touch response is bad.Took me 2 and half hours to charge full.When connected whatsApp to laptop the response is bad.When contacted samsung service center they said the phone has issues and will not be solved unless you get a software update.If the company knows the product is bad or not upto the mark it should not be online for sale.', 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Good One', 'Nice mobile under 15k.

While the phone had 10 day return policy on Amazon, when I called to return the phone, Amazon said they cannot accept return and window closed on morning of ten day and I was calling in afternoon. Never expected this behaviour from Amazon. I was asked to approach Samsung service centre.I did that and they simply reset the phone and told me that if the problem persists to go their repair centre whose address they gave. The problem remained unresolved so I approached their authorized repair centre. They kept the phone and asked me to contact after 2-3 days.Second shock, after 3 days, they gave the phone back after reset and told that the phone has been labelled as NDF (No Defect Found) status. They insisted that it never restarted once while they had it. Blatant lies being told by  authorized repair centre. I took the phone home. Problem persisted so I contacted Samsung helpline. They said to take the phone again to repair centre and they will repair properly.So went again and was told unofficially they dont repair brand new phones as they have earlier encountered customers who got the phones replaced as they didnt like the model.

They said they cant replace with another same phone and also they dont have any idea when the faulty part (phone motherboard) can be obtained by them.Fourth shock.

They claimed to do this at back end only as this kind of discount not available on website. I agreed to pay half the amount (twelve thousand) and of course it went into a black hole.Fifth shock, 2 December it will be TWO MONTHS since I bought the phone and still havent received from Samsung repair centre.

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far.

They all worked fine. But this time was different.This phone started restarting by itself which I initially put down to new phone being updated. But after a few days when it started happening four to five times a day, I decided to return the phone.First shock. While the phone had 10 day return policy on Amazon, when I called to return the phone, Amazon said they cannot accept return and window closed on morning of ten day and I was calling in afternoon. Never expected this behaviour from Amazon. I was asked to approach Samsung service centre.I did that and they simply reset the phone and told me that if the problem persists to go their repair centre whose address they gave. The problem remained unresolved so I approached their authorized repair centre. They kept the phone and asked me to contact after 2-3 days.Second shock, after 3 days, they gave the phone back after reset and told that the phone has been labelled as NDF (No Defect Found) status. They insisted that it never restarted once while they had it. Blatant lies being told by  authorized repair centre. I took the phone home. Problem persisted so I contacted Samsung helpline. They said to take the phone again to repair centre and they will repair properly.So went again and was told unofficially they dont repair brand new phones as they have earlier encountered customers who got the phones replaced as they didnt like the model. Second Shock. I said I never asked for a different phone. If you cant repair it replace the phone with a working phone.Third shock. They said they cant replace with another same phone and also they dont have any idea when the faulty part (phone motherboard) can be obtained by them.Fourth shock. I got hit on by scammers who knew the entire story of my phone (obviously from inside sources in the company/service centre) and offered to enable me to buy any Samsung phone at 40% discount (since I had suffered due to bad product from their company) and the balance will be adjusted when old phone will be returned. They claimed to do this at back end only as this kind of discount not available on website. I agreed to pay half the amount (twelve thousand) and of course it went into a black hole.Fifth shock, 2 December it will be TWO MONTHS since I bought the phone and still havent received from Samsung repair centre. This after 40-50 phone calls with repair centre and Samsung helpline.End of story, dont buy Samsung phones if dont like gambling. If it works, fine. If it doesnt, your money is gone.

Samsung finally moved on from outdated U-shaped notches and brought a punch hole.If you like viewing content, then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.>>SOUND: 9/10Dual speakers with Great sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.Sound is crisp, loud and clear.>>SOFTWARE: 10/10Another great aspect of this device. Well designed ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is not present, at a low price device which makes it really more useable.>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from Acer, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 400k and real-life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer, for me the performance is more than enough. no lags, no stutters and no app crashes.Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.>>CAMERA : 7.5/10One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.50 MP main camera has clicks great photos with typical Acer colors and great details.2 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses easily. OIS is not available in camera, videos, but the EIS works well.>>BATTERY : 9/10Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Fast Charging 33 watt charger that acer gives with the device, it takes 1.2 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.>>VERDICT:Finally a great budget phone from Acer that actually performs well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of Acer and Google safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot."", ""The Acer's newly launched model is no less than it's peers. I have been using this for a month or so and it stacked up great. Definitely recommend.Pros and Cons- Clean bloatware free UI, makes the phone fast and switching between apps is of no issue. Did not hang once.- Crisp Call quality with loud speakers.- Back Camera is Good but front camera is average and below par in low light.- Display quality of 120Hz is fine, but didn't use much in 120Hz though. 60Hz is fine for everyday usage.- Battery lasts for 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy.- Charging time is 45 mins from 15% to 85%, which is a bit slow.- Useful pre loaded gestures from Acer.- No heating issues as of now.- The phone feels a bit heavy.Overall great phone given the budget and its competitors.""]",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.2428118420741371,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tZWQnP4dL._SX679_.jpg

Despite its promising specifications, the overall experience has been disappointing, lacking the reliability and features I previously enjoyed.Call Quality and Features: The call experience with the Redmi 12 5G is plagued by frequent drops and network issues. The absence of a visible number typing area on the keypad and malfunctioning call recording further hinder usability. Additionally, mistouches during calls and the lack of a Bluetooth icon exacerbate usability issues. Furthermore, accidental calls to random contacts due to mistouches during calls add to the frustration.Messaging: Despite granting all permissions, saved contacts' names do not display, making it challenging to navigate messages. The inability to differentiate messages from unknown sources exacerbates the issue, as spam messages appear with misleading identities.User Interface (UI): The default UI is cumbersome, lacking essential customization options like horizontal menu pages. Third-party launchers like Nova Launcher are necessary for improved functionality, but gesture support is limited to the native HyperOS. UI lag and unresponsive notifications further mar the experience.Gallery and File Management: The gallery's organization is subpar, especially when distinguishing between internal storage and SD card content. Similarly, the file manager lacks basic search functionality, forcing users to manually scroll through directories.Camera and Speaker Quality: The camera performance falls below expectations for the price segment, producing subpar images. Additionally, the speaker exhibits erratic volume fluctuations, impacting audio quality during media playback.Handling and Display: The device's larger-than-expected size makes single-handed use difficult, leading to wrist discomfort. Outdoor visibility is poor due to inadequate brightness levels, resulting in reflective screen surfaces.Battery and Charging: While charging speed is acceptable, the battery life necessitates multiple charges for a single day of normal use, diminishing user convenience.Second Space Feature: The Second Space feature fails to match the functionality of Samsung's Knox, lacking essential capabilities such as seamless data transfer between spaces and restricted clipboard access.Comparison and Concerns: Comparing similar models like the Poco M6 Pro reveals discrepancies in pricing and specifications, indicating potential deception in the market. Such practices undermine consumer trust and warrant caution when considering Xiaomi devices.Conclusion: In conclusion, the Redmi 12 5G (6GB/128GB) fails to deliver on basic functionality and user experience, making it an unsatisfactory investment. Prospective buyers are advised to explore alternative options to avoid the frustration and inconvenience associated with this device."", 'Good product but not as expected.

If your use and style is similar to mine, you may really enjoy the phone."", ""On paper the product is good but in real it doesn't not fullfill the requirements as specified camera is worst, having a phone but we can't click a photo,the camera app automatically closes if you click photo and photo are also not saved in gallery. After many attempts of the photo is clicked than the picture quality is very poor, it provides photos as jio phone or any other 2mp camera phone.Phone is hanging alot in 1 week use as it seems it has been used for many years.I requested for replacement a technician was alloted and he said replacement will be done but it has been 5 days but I am receiving any response.The worst experience I have been using this phone.It only looks good,in hand it feels good but from inside it is worst why companies make such worst phone I don't understand.The Acer has broken my trust, it could not do better in mobile industry."", ""Bought this phone for Rs 11999.Package does not include a charger, so keep that in mind.>>DESIGN: 7/10Nothing special, Great Acer design with 3 vertically stacked cameras.Display bezels are a bit thicker than the competition, but they are uniform on all sides.Plastic back does not look good, no matter which color you choose, but a back cover solves that problem.>>DISPLAY: 10/10The best part about this device is the display, FDH+ super with punchy colors and great viewing angles. Samsung finally moved on from outdated U-shaped notches and brought a punch hole.If you like viewing content, then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.>>SOUND: 9/10Dual speakers with Great sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.Sound is crisp, loud and clear.>>SOFTWARE: 10/10Another great aspect of this device. Well designed ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is not present, at a low price device which makes it really more useable.>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from Acer, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 400k and real-life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer, for me the performance is more than enough. no lags, no stutters and no app crashes.Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.>>CAMERA : 7.5/10One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.50 MP main camera has clicks great photos with typical Acer colors and great details.2 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses easily. OIS is not available in camera, videos, but the EIS works well.>>BATTERY : 9/10Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Fast Charging 33 watt charger that acer gives with the device, it takes 1.2 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.>>VERDICT:Finally a great budget phone from Acer that actually performs well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of Acer and Google safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot."", ""The Acer's newly launched model is no less than it's peers. I have been using this for a month or so and it stacked up great. Definitely recommend.Pros and Cons- Clean bloatware free UI, makes the phone fast and switching between apps is of no issue. Did not hang once.- Crisp Call quality with loud speakers.- Back Camera is Good but front camera is average and below par in low light.- Display quality of 120Hz is fine, but didn't use much in 120Hz though. 60Hz is fine for everyday usage.- Battery lasts for 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy.- Charging time is 45 mins from 15% to 85%, which is a bit slow.- Useful pre loaded gestures from Acer.- No heating issues as of now.- The phone feels a bit heavy.Overall great phone given the budget and its competitors.""]",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.2428118420741371,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514rF5FWrsL._SX679_.jpg

Tamper proof package. Working great.', 'Very useful. I kept tracking my luggage while travelling.', 'Original and genuine', 'After using it for 10 months, I can confidently say it\'s become a really valuable little gadget for me, especially as someone who\'s always a bit anxious about losing things, particularly my car!Where it Shines:1. Car Parking Savior: This is where the AirTag has really proven its worth for me. Whether it\'s the sprawling parking lots at malls or navigating tricky city parking, forgetting where I parked used to be a constant stress. Now, I just park, and I know I can quickly pull up the ""Find My"" app and pinpoint my car\'s location. It\'s incredibly convenient and saves me time and frustration.2. Travel Companion - Airport Baggage Peace: Airports can be chaotic, and the conveyor belt scramble for luggage is always a bit nerve-wracking. Having the AirTag in my checked bag gives me a fantastic sense of security. Knowing I can check if my bag is on the right belt, or at least still with me as I travel through the airport, is a huge stress reliever. It’s also given me peace of mind thinking about theft during travel – while I hope it never happens, knowing I have a way to potentially track my bag is a comfort.3. General Peace of Mind: Beyond specific uses, just knowing I have this little tracker attached to something important gives me a general sense of calm. It’s simple, unobtrusive, and it works.Things to Consider (The Fine Print):1. iPhone Ecosystem Dependency: This is a big one – the AirTag relies heavily on the Apple ecosystem. Its location accuracy depends on being near other iPhones. In more remote areas, or if you\'re really out of range of other Apple devices, its effectiveness might be limited. This is just the nature of how it works, but something to be aware of.2. Precision Finding Range: The ""Precision Finding"" feature, which is super cool and accurate for really pinpointing the AirTag, only kicks in when you\'re within about 20 meters. Before that, you\'re relying on a less precise location on the map. It\'s not a deal-breaker, but just know you need to get relatively close for that super-accurate guidance.Overall:Despite the reliance on the Apple network and the precision finding range limitations, the AirTag has genuinely impressed me. For anyone already invested in the Apple ecosystem, and especially if you\'re looking for a simple and effective way to track your car, luggage, or other valuables and gain some real peace of mind, I highly recommend the AirTag.  It’s a well-designed product that delivers on its promise.Would I Recommend? Yes, especially for car owners and frequent travelers within the Apple ecosystem.', 'Good product', 'It’s an AirTag, it does what it’s told.', 'The product is not working it is defective  piece', 'Satisfied with sound quality product.

For example, during a recent 5 km run, the watch showed only 3.9 km, which is a significant discrepancy. It's frustrating to see inconsistent data.- *Glitchy Interface*: The watch's interface is slow and unresponsive at times. I've experienced freezes and crashes, which is annoying.- Time difference- watch on the other was 4 hours and 5 minute behind actual timing- Product support is nightmare , talking with them from 07 days but no proper solution just proscratination by support team of Amazon’s ne amazefit watchOverall, I'm disappointed with the Amazefit smartwatch.

Lots of information from stress, SPO2, calorie, sleep, HRV, etc (list goes on)6. Always on display and wrist movement to wake up works with hardly any issueSomething which really annoys -1. Non-accurately counting steps. I’d say 80-85% accuracy specially if you are not selecting any workout mode like walking, running, etc.In a normal walk, you walk 100 steps and it counts it 120 and that’s annoyingIt is far more accurate when in a workout mode like walking, running etc2. It measures numbers of hours spent standing and that is way inaccurate (like maybe 20% accurate). It’ll show you like 5 hours in standing position whereas you’d know you have probably spent 1.5 hours or so.3. “Tap to wake” is missingSummary -If you are looking for a reasonable priced  watch which feels premium and has features, you can go fit it.However, the fact that accuracy of health metrics is questionable, I don’t see a reason why one should buy this over rather cheaper watches which are equally or even  more accurate.', 'Very good product and I love the looks and information it provides.

It looks better, the quality and build seem better, like it might actually last longer, and the zepp app which comes with it is brilliant. The insights are great, again, way more detailed than Fitbit! The watch itself has a really clear, bright screen, and even displays photos and videos! I can even get my ring doorbell on it. It's very versatile to suit your needs, with so many different features and there's lots of clock faces to choose from to personalise it, some free, some paid. It was really easy to set up and connect to my phone. Battery life is insane too, I've just gone 10 days since my first charge without charging it. I've just now put it on charge, it was still on 25% so not desperate (for this watch anyway).  I cannot recommend this watch enough for looks, versatility, ease of use, battery life, and price point.

This 9000 phone I'm using from past two years and it is working smoothly even today. Battery is long enough to last even for two days in moderate usage. Expandable ram works well if enough internal space is available. Build quality is also good. It has sustained many drops and impacts. Charging speed is way too fast with it's 33W Super vooc charger.Cons- Camera quality is not that good. Display quality is also average and may hurt your eyes in longer usage."", 'Just a little higher in price according to the quality and features', ""For the price of 8999 this is truly an amazing phone in terms of performance, smoothness weight and comfortability to use. I exchanged this with a Redmi 9A and compared to that this device is 100 times better.The camera is amazing, battery backup is fantastic and charging is super fast. There are no lags when switching apps and there are many useful features which are seen in Moto phones that I could find on this device.Having said that I was surprised to find some basic features missing or complicated compared to Samsung or Redmi phones.- There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.- There is no option to create folder or group icons together. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. For example all your UPI apps will be mixed up all over the app drawer and cannot be grouped under a single folder in this device. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit. I have to say that this device at 8999 outperforms my 15000 Samsung in every aspect.I only hope they will take care of the missing or convoluted basic feature issues that I mentioned before to make this phone a true super hero!."", ""Pls anyone not purchase mobiles at  amazon once you purchase mobile then not  ready to replacement  pressure to do service only sale low quality product also thn pressure only service if you do call to customer thn connect to service team & pressure to do service  every time not ready to gave return or replacement with in 7 dayI purchase real me narzoN53 last 9-11-23 but after recive product put to charge  mobile charge only 80%in morninge to evening also not recive perfect signals were my old mob recive mob signals in tht places this mobile not recive signals also internet speed is very slowThts I put into replacement 11-11-23 but not able to  put replacement thn I call to customer care customer care executives connect to tech team tech team suggest to bring mob in to nearest real me service centre  & product return at service centre but in service not agree to return or replacement only agree to serviceThen again I cal to customer care 4-5 times every time executives  connect to technical team & pressure to do service I ask to all anyone ready to service new product before use ?That's I think to amazon contract with company to sale poor quality product ( not moving fast in market)Thts from today I exit from amazon and suggest to friends also not purchase at amazonI am regular customer of amazon store but I so feel bad from this purchase &.

It's stock Android without any bloatware.2. If your data is backed up on Google, it syncs and downloads smoothly.3. Once set up, it gives instant response to app usage, including banking and finance apps, Amazon, ticket booking apps, etc. My phone use now saves me so much time because of the fast response.4. The charger adapter is just over 20W so perfect for Type C fast charging, and the cable is heavy duty braided. Fast charging time, and I'm getting about a day and a half with normal use, and there's usually around 30% left at the end of a day of a lot of use. Of course, the phone is new, and I'm sure this will change as it gets older.5. The 65 MP camera features both various auto as well as manual modes, and while I'm not fussy about photos, I'm very happy with the landscape and skyscape photos I've taken at different times of the day, including in the evening. I haven't yet tried night photos.6. There are several utility features like a compass, which I actually use.7. The keyboard software is intuitive and responds well to sweep typing which I extensively use.8. Some Android features like YouTube Music, Google One, etc. you can uninstall if you don't need them and want to save space.9. The gel phone case works fine for me and fits well like for any stock Android phone.10. Since I only use a bluetooth speaker or headphones, the sounds and volume controls have been fine for me.11. Note - the fingerprint sensor is on the side - right side, third button down, but if you include for both hands, it actually works easier if you use your free hand for fingerprint unlocking, so I prefer this to the back-located sensor.12. The phone is dual SIM, but note that SIM1 is nano, but SIM2 is micro, so you want to make sure you keep your SIM adapters.13. Storage - this was really the only negative - with so many good features, it was rather odd that SIM2 slot is also the storage slot, but only for TF cards, not micro SD cards. Since these are not interchangeable, you have to invest in a TF card which is old school compared to SD cards, and it also means you can't use two SIMs and a storage card. Since I will be using two SIMs in the future, I just have to make sure that I'm not using my phone as a basic storage unit and backing up my data esp photos and videos on the cloud. I prefer a fast response to storing a lot of media. So, I prefer to create things for social media on my computer and transfer via cloud so I can use it on my phone.14. Weightwise, the phone is about 200g, so about an average Nokia weight. I've already dropped it twice by mistake, and am relieved to find it continues fine, but it's much better to be careful with the phone.15. Screen visuality is good, and since I use backed up display and phone settings which I downloaded to my phone, the phone looks exactly like how I want it to. That's up to you to configure - the phone has great wallpapers, themes, and a very wide range of ring and notification tones, so you can discard what you don't want.I think it's been the best phone buy I've made till now, and I usually never say I love my phone - I'm saying it now, and I'm very happy with the value for money I've received. If your use and style is similar to mine, you may really enjoy the phone."", ""On paper the product is good but in real it doesn't not fullfill the requirements as specified camera is worst, having a phone but we can't click a photo,the camera app automatically closes if you click photo and photo are also not saved in gallery. After many attempts of the photo is clicked than the picture quality is very poor, it provides photos as jio phone or any other 2mp camera phone.Phone is hanging alot in 1 week use as it seems it has been used for many years.I requested for replacement a technician was alloted and he said replacement will be done but it has been 5 days but I am receiving any response.The worst experience I have been using this phone.It only looks good,in hand it feels good but from inside it is worst why companies make such worst phone I don't understand.The Acer has broken my trust, it could not do better in mobile industry."", ""Bought this phone for Rs 11999.Package does not include a charger, so keep that in mind.>>DESIGN: 7/10Nothing special, Great Acer design with 3 vertically stacked cameras.Display bezels are a bit thicker than the competition, but they are uniform on all sides.Plastic back does not look good, no matter which color you choose, but a back cover solves that problem.>>DISPLAY: 10/10The best part about this device is the display, FDH+ super with punchy colors and great viewing angles. Samsung finally moved on from outdated U-shaped notches and brought a punch hole.If you like viewing content, then you are in for a treat. Display quality is comparable to what other brands offer in a segment above.>>SOUND: 9/10Dual speakers with Great sound, ideal for media consumption. Upper speaker has a bit less volume compared to the bottom one, still it gives a good stereo effect.Sound is crisp, loud and clear.>>SOFTWARE: 10/10Another great aspect of this device. Well designed ui with tons of features and device level optimizations. Bloatware is not present, at a low price device which makes it really more useable.>>PERFORMANCE : 8/10Surprise, surprise. A well performing phone budget phone from Acer, isn't it great? Antutu scores are above 400k and real-life performance is also good. I'm not a gamer, for me the performance is more than enough. no lags, no stutters and no app crashes.Phone doesn't heat up in normal usage and video calls, can't tell about gaming, coz I'm not a gamer.>>CAMERA : 7.5/10One of the best set of cameras available on any budget phone. PERIOD.50 MP main camera has clicks great photos with typical Acer colors and great details.2 MP ultrawide is good for occasional photography and making wide angle videos. Wish it was 13MP.2 MP macro is useless as always. Just don't know why manufacturers give it.13 MP Selfie camera is good, produces social media ready pictures.4k video capture is supported from both front and back cameras & you can also switch in between wide and normal lenses easily. OIS is not available in camera, videos, but the EIS works well.>>BATTERY : 9/10Battery life is great, gives a screen on time of 8-9 hours on a single charge. Will easily last 2 days on medium usage and 1 full day on heavy usage. Fast Charging 33 watt charger that acer gives with the device, it takes 1.2 hrs to charge fully. I'm getting 2 days backup with 5g turned on all the time and about an hour of video calls and some social media.>>VERDICT:Finally a great budget phone from Acer that actually performs well. Camera is great, display is beautiful, speakers are good , battery life is descent and software support is unmatched. Plus the brand value of Acer and Google safety along with it make this a great deal for people who do not game a lot."", ""The Acer's newly launched model is no less than it's peers. I have been using this for a month or so and it stacked up great. Definitely recommend.Pros and Cons- Clean bloatware free UI, makes the phone fast and switching between apps is of no issue. Did not hang once.- Crisp Call quality with loud speakers.- Back Camera is Good but front camera is average and below par in low light.- Display quality of 120Hz is fine, but didn't use much in 120Hz though. 60Hz is fine for everyday usage.- Battery lasts for 1 and half day with moderate usage and 1 day with heavy.- Charging time is 45 mins from 15% to 85%, which is a bit slow.- Useful pre loaded gestures from Acer.- No heating issues as of now.- The phone feels a bit heavy.Overall great phone given the budget and its competitors.""]",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.2428118420741371,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AXDnUqc8L._SX679_.jpg

Usage journey is summarised below for other users to optimise it for higher performance, battery efficiency & nil bloatware experience.Its a clear equivalent of Redmi 12 5G except NFC.  I saw many users write about it having ads and bloatware, issues with battery drain, etc.  These issues can be resolved to a great extent as I did.As soon as it was put on the network, it downloaded Xiaomi HyperOS1.0.1.0 UMWINXM, ANDROID 14.  The update was 4.4GB, took some time but the OS is as smooth as MIUI 14/ Android 13.Battery drain can be simply reduced by using the Battery saver mode.  Further, you require to fine tune on background apps and disable ads, remove recommendations to reduce irritation.  Camera is decent.  Processor performance is good, no lagging.  However, the famous quickball has been removed.  For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed.  With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years.  So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions.  I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware.Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery.  The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. It also reduces the risk of load on charger circuit due to lower charging current and no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), so battery and peripheral components remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I preferred a thicker back cover.Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume.  But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use.The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up.Finally, Amazon delivery was on time.  Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+.  Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly.When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone.No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.UPDATE 2:We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type.  But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that.  So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced.  Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings.  If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024):The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily.  Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free.  Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt  default 'Messaging' app  I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control.  Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'.  A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones.  Quality of hardware is very good and performing.  With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features.  Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode.  I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory.  Only if needed, I will configure it.  I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024):A bug is identified on HyperOS.  When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made.  Incoming calls also do not get through.  I have tested this multiple times.  Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug.  Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally.  This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money.  Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range.  Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024):When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore.  A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date.  Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder.  Then restore that file.  While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre.  The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch.  I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell.  Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3.  Others can enjoy too.UPDATE 6.. For 6 GB/ 128 GB Version (31 July 2024):I have also bought the 6 GB/ 128 GB variant.  Having hardened the HyperOS, this phone is almost a stock android like with nil bloatware.  The usage time has increased since the memory utilisation has reduced and with it, the battery lasts slightly longer as compared to the 8 GB/ 256 GB variant.  You would notice that Xiaomi has released the Poco M6 plus and Redmi 13 5g variant last month using the same processor by little overclocking (they call it accelarated or AE) to 2.3 GHz instead of 2.2 GHz,  adding a 120 Hz display and 108 MP camera, etc with 35% higher price for 6GB/ 128GB.  Well, I am contented with the M6Pro 5g's price to performance since frying the CPU may reduce its life.Regards.....

The company claims it to be 5000 mah, but I'm sure it is not more than 4000 mah. It drops very quickly.Chargingis pretty good and faster. 30 mins of charging gives 30% battery life. But due to very low battery quality, you might need to charge it twice a day.The phone is lighter than majority of phones, and look wise it is more attractive.CameraIs the best part I liked the most. Any other phones don't have such camera quality at this price segment.Ram Rom performance is v.good and storage of 128gb is enough. With 6 gb Ram. This phone is ditto copy of Redmi 12, but that is at ₹12500, only difference is the branding. I suggest you to buy this one Poco m6 pro, which is way cheaper.Sound Quality is decent at this price.Rest all the features performs really well and I bought this at a discount @ ₹9999.I'm happy with this product for the price I paid.If you can afford ₹3000 than this range, then definitely go for some other options, because poco has boasted this product a lot.

I've been using the watch for about 10 months and this watch exceeded all my expectations. I primarily use it to track my sleep and running and it does the job well.

It is misusing skin temperature sensor and Ohealth app can be improved with modern AI features.Heart rate monitoring:5/5Comfort:4/5Quality:4/5Performance:5/5"", ""I moved to this watch after my Fitbit charge 5 died after a year (and before that Fitbit sense, died after a year and half) and lack of support frustrated enough to ditch it and move to something which is more reliable and have fitness insights.

Here is what I experienced..Look and build:* Excellent design and looks. Many watch faces to chose from.* Sturdy and durable build quality* Feels super premiumUser experience:* Excellent Google Wear OS experience* Smooth and responsive UI, no lag at all* Very convenient to see all notification on the wrist, which can be controlled of course to avoid distraction* We can reply to WhatsApp chat or other apps through watch if needed. Excellent watch keyboard for quick reply.* Calling on watch is excellent* Very convenient to change music track while doing workout as I put mobile aside during workouts.* Various workout and fitness stats are also available in watch* OHealth app is good and easy to useWorkout and fitness:* Excellent workout stats and analysis* Great Sleep analysis* Sensors are very accurate. Heartrate, SPO2, Sleep detection, balance everything is accurate. GPS is also accurate while we do outdoor workout like running/walking etc.* Note that heartrate sensors are continuously measuring during workout only. Without workout it measures periodically (may be once in a minute or so).Few activities have in depth statistics for example running, tennis, badminton. There could be more but I could test these only so far. Check attached screenshots to see the stats.Running:Very accurate running stats. Sensors are able to measure all readings and shows in depth statistics. It also shows cardiovascular stats. GPS is also very accurate and able to track the route while I was running in a street having 16 story apartments on both the sides.Pickleball:* I used tennis workout to track pickleball and it was able to capture stats like number of forehead, backend shots, max swing speed accurately. See the attached image.Weights and strength training:* There is strength training workout option. There is also upper limb, lower limb, back, chest and different workouts, they all essentially measures heart rate continuously. Not much in depth analysis but it captures in which zone you did these workout.Charging:* With breathing analysis on which is battery intensive, I get 2.5 to 3 days battery, provided that I do 1 to 1.5 hours daily workout, which also uses battery as sensors are continuously on during workout. It's not a problem for me as there is quick charting. If I turn of breathing analysis then battery might get extended by 1 to 1.5 days.Pros:* Excellent premium look with great build quality* Price - Excellent wear os watch, with this quality and features at this price* Great workouts and statistics* Very good calling experience* Excellent sleep analysisCons:* A bit heavier and bulky if you are moving from some light weight tracker. If someone is already using other watch and buying this then won't observe this as an issue. Infect they might find this a bit lighter.Good to have:* Continuous heart rate monitoring - it measures heart rate continuously during activity and sleep (when advanced breathing assessment is on), but not otherwise* Readiness score - Score which tells how much workout you can do today, based on how your body and heart responded to yesterday's workout Probably somewhat covered under recovery stats"", 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:More watch face should be available', '3-4 days battery lifeFarely Accurate gps and fitness trackingGood sleep, heart rate tracking, spo2 and allNot much comfortable for long time to wearGood connectivitySpeakers and quality also acceptable', 'Easy to setup and pair.

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far.

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far.

But I wouldn't recommend playing online multiplayer games like BGMI as it could heat the phone. The brightness is appropriate, you can see under the sun, the display. The camera is also good and I will recommend to buy this. See if you are getting this phone under 18k then go for it as it is value for money with all the essential features. The display is good.

Superb AmoLED display with that curve.... Wow it's too great.... It looks like you own a 50k+ mobile2. Camera quality is decent.. but have so much filters will blow and surprise you lol... I mean about photos... Video is on average .. yes you can shoot on 4k but the stability is too lowBut once again guys the photo is awesome with those filters I am totally satisfied3. Superfast GPU and RAM..4. Awesome in-hand experience.5. No blotwares I say nothing only stock apps like we needed Google apps as we use daily6. So much built in features like a samsung Max phones have.. especially the preventive touch option, in display scanner, lock app option, lock folder option, clone app function, ram enhance, those camera filters are awesome especially on front cam.. I say oppo filters will be 2nd if we compare both7. Taptics... Wow it's too awesome I say samsung and iPhone will have to get that hands on effects.. it's too good... I recomend to disable the sound effect while we clicking8. The intelligent part is it's using a stock Android OS so we can disable almost anything.CONS1. As this product is newly launched its case and screen guard is still not provided on Amazon. But It says it got the newer Gorilla glass protection and won't need screen guard... Hmmm I still need to figure it out2. As I said the phone case also is not available, we got a back clear cover with the phone but it's too low quality. I am sure it will turn yellow in 4 weeks ( a secret... I found a full glass case 3 in 1 on f l I p k a r t. I ordered it will update when I get that3. As I use currently a iPhone 8... It's too builky on my pockets and always keep opening screen and asking to use my fingure print to open. There is a option to disable accidental screen pressing but it still annoying and drain battery slowly ( so when I put the phone on pockets, I try to put the way that the front camera is on the front side .. open side4. It's fast charging is awesome but there is nothing to prevent the phone to put slow charging when it reach 80% and go normal. It rush to 100% and turn off charging ( I heard that after having 80% battery it's not good to fast charging... I am low with tech.. so leaving to those tech guys for a better review5. The back clear case which the company provided is not good. Just back case . Can't protect as the camera part is buldged6. Amazon didn't allow to get additional warranty as they give to other phones with price of 1500-2000, that's really bad7. No amazon sellers provide accidental or water protection damage replacement8. Also LAVA say they will replace the product at home for 1 year. But for only hardware issues... So I recomend to keep this phone as a babyFinally I love this awesome product which I got it lately after getting so many comparisons and much more waiting. They told to serve it in 2 days but need to be patient as I got it after 9 days...Update after 1 Month... We won't get any back case or flip case for the product.. the screen protector available is a substitute f om. Vivo v27+ but it's UV glass.. after scratch we need to remove carefully after 1 hour try slowly and peacefully else you will ruin the AmoLED displayI request the company to release more good cases and add the insurance to protect the devise as the other gadgets give us"", ""Review after almost one year of use:The major issue is the display, not with the specs but using an older amoled display technology which causes a lot of screen-burn even at lower brightness. This is really annoying and the main issue. Even 30 mins of Google maps will cause burn-in. So there's that.Also the camera hardware is good but the software is stock mediatek camera app which sucks. There's not even a good gcam support.The performance is ok but at the time of this review, there are  even powerful phones even from lava itself at a lower price.The battery lasts till end of day if normal usage, not with gaming, it drains fast of gaming but the charging speed makes up for it.It can be used for light gaming,but for games like genshin impact even at lowest settings have a lot of frame-dips. But some games are optimised like asphalt 9 can run 60fps even at medium-high settings.The wifi and data speeds are good, the maximum mobile data speed I reached is 720Mbps (or 90MBps). It can install an apl with 500MB in less than 15 seconds (with average wifi or data coverage).The software is just stock android witha very little minor features, which is a bummer. By the time of this review, it still runs android 14.The screen is not durable, it does not have any protection and scratches easily, so atleast an screen protector is recommended. Also, tempered glass for this is hard to find, because of curved display."", 'I am waiting this review after 2 years of heavy use. Believe me guys this is the best phone in this price range.

Do not expect wonders if you are planning to buy this phone. As the headline suggests, it is not for everyone.1. The build quality is good and the weight feels perfect as it is not on the heavier side. Since the weight distribution is good, it\'s easy to handle with one hand despite the screen size being close to ""massive"".2. The AMOLED screen works it\'s magic while watching videos. My primary aim to buy this phone was for viewing purpose since I spend a lot of time on YouTube and other streaming platforms. The color distribution is a chef\'s kiss since it does not try to forcibly add gradients. More on the natural side and hence the viewing experience will feel pleasant.3. Sound could have been better. The mono speakers feels cheap but yet surprisingly does the job. I use speakers and headphones so that it\'s that big of an issue for me (but if you depend on phone speakers for your entertainment, better look for another phone possibly POCO for stereo speakers at the same price point but then you will miss out on the display part )4. CHARGING ISSUE? The answer is NO, Although it\'s been just a day using this phone, i did not face any issues. I was skeptical after reading the reviews about the charging issues. It\'s true that I faced a little hiccup when i first charged the phone right after unboxing where the connection is interrupted during charger but that was just for a few seconds (Give it some time and the charging connection issue will disappear). Further the Hyper OS update completely rectified the issue.5. Refresh rate at 120Hz noticeably improves the social media experience. Brightness is good and you won\'t have any issues using the phone in sunlight. Switch to optimal settings for better using experience6. 5G works like a charm for me with JIO giving speeds of over 250 Mbps most of the time (Depends on the 5G zones. Some of you might get even better since stay near the outskirts of the city)7. Gaming: Not yet tested but it doesn\'t matter a lot to me so that\'s fine.8. Camera : Low light photos are good but make sure to stabilize your hand or else it would be blurry. 108 MP camera photos are good and provide good detailing. It could definitely have been a lot better but this phone is not for camera enthusiasts. If you like to create memories by clicking photos and not fuss about the details about them you can definitely go for it.Overall do not exclude this phone from your options (if you are planning on buying this) just by reading the negative reviews. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews. People should update their phones to the latest firmware to bring out the best and eliminate any bugs.', ""The Redmi Note 13 5G in Arctic White (6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) offers a compelling package for its price, hitting many of the right notes for a mid-range smartphone in 2024.Performance & Functionality: Powered by the Dimensity 6080, the phone handles everyday tasks with ease. Navigating the UI, social media, and casual gaming are generally smooth. While it won't break benchmark records, it's perfectly capable for most users. The 108MP Pro-Grade Camera is a significant highlight, capturing surprisingly detailed photos in good lighting, offering excellent functionality for photography enthusiasts in this segment.Value for Money: This is where the Redmi Note 13 5G truly shines. For what you pay, you're getting a lot of features typically found in higher-priced devices, making it an excellent value proposition.Connectivity: Being 5G ready is a big plus for future-proofing, and connectivity has been consistently reliable. Call quality is clear, and Wi-Fi performance is stable.Display Brightness: The 120Hz Bezel-Less AMOLED display is a joy to behold. It boasts excellent colors and smoothness, and with a peak brightness of around 1000 nits, it's quite usable even in bright outdoor conditions, which is crucial for a phone intended for daily use in sunny places like Dharashiv.Fingerprint Sensor: The side-mounted fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, offering a quick and convenient way to unlock the phone.While it delivers a great overall experience, some users might find minor compromises in areas like heavy gaming performance or advanced camera features compared to more expensive phones.

Still, they told me it\'s my responsibility to check for a service center.— My question is: when I enter my pincode during purchase, why doesn\'t Amazon inform me that there’s no service center in my area?This experience made me feel like I was shopping on a fake or untrustworthy website.To make things worse, I felt very uncomfortable during the conversation. The way the support team spoke to me made it seem like I was being blamed for buying the product on Amazon.This has been the worst experience I\'ve had with Amazon.', 'Amazing product', ""If it's connected to your android giving backup only max 48 hours"", 'The media could not be loaded.After using the Amazfit GTR 2e for almost two years, I decided to upgrade to the Amazfit GTR 4 and One of the main reasons I stick to Amazfit is the excellent battery backup, which is crucial for me. While the GTR 4 offers slightly less battery life compared to the GTR 2e (around 8-10 days on moderate use), it’s understandable given the added features and enhanced performance.The build quality, display, and features make it a standout in this price range. If you value battery life and advanced functionality in a smartwatch, this is definitely the best choice. Highly recommend it!', 'I purchased the Amazfit GTR 4 from Amazon India on 16th December 2024, expecting a high-quality and dependable smartwatch. Unfortunately, within just a few months, the device stopped functioning — the touchscreen became unresponsive, and the battery started draining unusually fast.Following the support team’s instructions, I sent the watch to their service center. While I did receive confirmation of its arrival, it’s now been over three weeks with no further updates — no status, no estimated timeline, nothing.The complete lack of communication and follow-up has been incredibly frustrating.

It\'s not bulky, making it easy to carry in a backpack without adding much weight.Supplied USB C cable is okay build quality and bit short also.However, it doesn’t have a shockproof body, so you’ll want to handle it with a bit of care.⚡ Charging PerformanceRecharges at an impressive speed, both when charging itself and when powering other devices.The built-in display is very handy for monitoring output, input, and remaining battery.💻 Use Case: Charging LaptopsMy main reason for buying this was to charge two laptops simultaneously:Dell Latitude 5420 (USB-C input): Charges well, although the laptop displays a ""slow charging"" warning. Despite the warning, charging speed is quite good in real usage.Dell Latitude 7300 (7.4mm barrel input): Also charges effectively using a compatible USB-C to barrel connector.Keep in mind, devices like laptops and smartphones (e.g., my Samsung S21 FE) charge according to their internal power management algorithms, so they may not always charge at full speed even if the power bank supports it.💰 Value for MoneySlightly on the expensive side, but if your use case involves charging multiple high-power devices, it\'s worth the investment.Reliable performance and brand trust from Anker make it a dependable choice.🛫 Comparison with AlternativesIf you\'re considering alternatives, the Ugreen Nexode 300W Power Bank offers more power, but its large size can be a drawback for travel, especially on flights.✅ ConclusionIf your budget allows and portability is important, the Anker Prime 27600 is a solid pick.', ""The media could not be loaded.Ultimate beast in 2025.

Quite bulky so not portable to carry in your pocket.Also please note do not charge the powerbank always to 100% as it will reduce the charging cycle which is quite limited.Overall a good purchase if your requirement is fast charging on the go for specific and multiple devices. In my case its the Rog Ally and my mirorless camera.', 'Perfekte Powerbank für Starlink Mini – ideal für unterwegs und auf ReisenIch habe diese Powerbank speziell für den mobilen Betrieb meines Starlink Mini gekauft, da sie mit knapp unter 100\u202fWh genau innerhalb der Fluggrenzwerte liegt. Heute konnte ich sie im Auto testen – mit dem originalen USB-C-Kabel von Starlink. Den 12-V-Ausgang habe ich nicht verwendet, da die Powerbank über USB-C bereits hervorragend funktionierte.Während der Fahrt (gleichzeitig ein Praxistest für Starlink) hat sich die Powerbank sehr gut bewährt. Starlink lief stabil und war jederzeit zuverlässig mit Strom versorgt. Nach 51 Minuten Fahrt, bei der vier Geräte per WLAN verbunden waren und rund 8\u202fGB Daten übertragen wurden, zeigte die Powerbank noch exakt 69\u202f% Kapazität an.Das Nachladen von 69\u202f% auf 100\u202f% mit meinem iPad-Pro-Netzteil (18\u202fW) dauerte etwa 1 Stunde und 20 Minuten. Ich bin rundum zufrieden. Jetzt suche ich nur noch nach einem passenden Reiseadapter (EU/USA/Australien) mit höherer Leistung, um die Powerbank unterwegs noch schneller laden zu können.Als Bonus: Die Powerbank verfügt über Bluetooth, eine Smartphone-App und wird mit einer praktischen Transporttasche geliefert. Sehr durchdacht – klare Kaufempfehlung!EN: Perfect power bank for Starlink Mini – ideal for travel and mobile useI bought this power bank specifically for running my Starlink Mini on the go, as it’s just under the 100\u202fWh limit allowed by airlines. Today I tested it in my car using the original Starlink USB-C cable. I didn’t use the 12\u202fV output, since USB-C already worked flawlessly.During the drive (which served as a real-life Starlink test), the power bank performed excellently. Starlink remained stable and was consistently powered. After a 51-minute drive with four devices connected via Wi-Fi and about 8\u202fGB of data used, the power bank still had exactly 69\u202f% battery remaining.Charging it from 69\u202f% to 100\u202f% with my iPad Pro 18\u202fW charger took around 1 hour and 20 minutes. I’m completely satisfied. Now I’m just looking for a suitable travel adapter (EU/USA/Australia) with higher wattage for faster charging on the go.Bonus: The power bank includes Bluetooth connectivity, a smartphone app, and a convenient carrying case. Well-designed – highly recommended!', 'Powerbank is solid. Charges quick, depending on the charging cables you are using. I think they should supply good powerful charging cables with the powerbank.Many ports. Different ones so you can charge mutiple phones, laptops etc.It is heavy, then again it is a powerful machine. I would suggest buying the case for it.', ""This is, by far, the best external battery I've ever had."", 'جدا رائع 👌', ""I've bought multiple Anker products over the years—probably around six different Anker battery banks for myself and my family. I picked up this Anker Prime Power Bank because I recently bought the Ulanzi AL60 inflatable air tube light, which requires a power bank with a USB-C port that supports 100W output. This one worked perfectly.It's also incredibly sturdy. I've accidentally dropped it a couple of times, and it didn’t get a single scratch—no damage at all.Overall, another solid product from Anker.""]",General Satisfaction & Overall Experience,0.2353571428571428,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W6GzgNeNL._SX679_.jpg

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far. Did not see the phone over heating issue.Samsung has produced a quality product. I would definitely recommend this. It’s a good buy.', 'This is the worst product I have ever used from samsung.The touch response is bad.Took me 2 and half hours to charge full.When connected whatsApp to laptop the response is bad.When contacted samsung service center they said the phone has issues and will not be solved unless you get a software update.If the company knows the product is bad or not upto the mark it should not be online for sale.', 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Good One', 'Nice mobile under 15k.

Do not expect wonders if you are planning to buy this phone. As the headline suggests, it is not for everyone.1. The build quality is good and the weight feels perfect as it is not on the heavier side. Since the weight distribution is good, it\'s easy to handle with one hand despite the screen size being close to ""massive"".2. The AMOLED screen works it\'s magic while watching videos. My primary aim to buy this phone was for viewing purpose since I spend a lot of time on YouTube and other streaming platforms. The color distribution is a chef\'s kiss since it does not try to forcibly add gradients. More on the natural side and hence the viewing experience will feel pleasant.3. Sound could have been better. The mono speakers feels cheap but yet surprisingly does the job. I use speakers and headphones so that it\'s that big of an issue for me (but if you depend on phone speakers for your entertainment, better look for another phone possibly POCO for stereo speakers at the same price point but then you will miss out on the display part )4. CHARGING ISSUE? The answer is NO, Although it\'s been just a day using this phone, i did not face any issues. I was skeptical after reading the reviews about the charging issues. It\'s true that I faced a little hiccup when i first charged the phone right after unboxing where the connection is interrupted during charger but that was just for a few seconds (Give it some time and the charging connection issue will disappear). Further the Hyper OS update completely rectified the issue.5. Refresh rate at 120Hz noticeably improves the social media experience. Brightness is good and you won\'t have any issues using the phone in sunlight. Switch to optimal settings for better using experience6. 5G works like a charm for me with JIO giving speeds of over 250 Mbps most of the time (Depends on the 5G zones. Some of you might get even better since stay near the outskirts of the city)7. Gaming: Not yet tested but it doesn\'t matter a lot to me so that\'s fine.8. Camera : Low light photos are good but make sure to stabilize your hand or else it would be blurry. 108 MP camera photos are good and provide good detailing. It could definitely have been a lot better but this phone is not for camera enthusiasts. If you like to create memories by clicking photos and not fuss about the details about them you can definitely go for it.Overall do not exclude this phone from your options (if you are planning on buying this) just by reading the negative reviews. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews. People should update their phones to the latest firmware to bring out the best and eliminate any bugs.', ""The Redmi Note 13 5G in Arctic White (6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) offers a compelling package for its price, hitting many of the right notes for a mid-range smartphone in 2024.Performance & Functionality: Powered by the Dimensity 6080, the phone handles everyday tasks with ease. Navigating the UI, social media, and casual gaming are generally smooth. While it won't break benchmark records, it's perfectly capable for most users. The 108MP Pro-Grade Camera is a significant highlight, capturing surprisingly detailed photos in good lighting, offering excellent functionality for photography enthusiasts in this segment.Value for Money: This is where the Redmi Note 13 5G truly shines. For what you pay, you're getting a lot of features typically found in higher-priced devices, making it an excellent value proposition.Connectivity: Being 5G ready is a big plus for future-proofing, and connectivity has been consistently reliable. Call quality is clear, and Wi-Fi performance is stable.Display Brightness: The 120Hz Bezel-Less AMOLED display is a joy to behold. It boasts excellent colors and smoothness, and with a peak brightness of around 1000 nits, it's quite usable even in bright outdoor conditions, which is crucial for a phone intended for daily use in sunny places like Dharashiv.Fingerprint Sensor: The side-mounted fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, offering a quick and convenient way to unlock the phone.While it delivers a great overall experience, some users might find minor compromises in areas like heavy gaming performance or advanced camera features compared to more expensive phones.

Usage journey is summarised below for other users to optimise it for higher performance, battery efficiency & nil bloatware experience.Its a clear equivalent of Redmi 12 5G except NFC.  I saw many users write about it having ads and bloatware, issues with battery drain, etc.  These issues can be resolved to a great extent as I did.As soon as it was put on the network, it downloaded Xiaomi HyperOS1.0.1.0 UMWINXM, ANDROID 14.  The update was 4.4GB, took some time but the OS is as smooth as MIUI 14/ Android 13.Battery drain can be simply reduced by using the Battery saver mode.  Further, you require to fine tune on background apps and disable ads, remove recommendations to reduce irritation.  Camera is decent.  Processor performance is good, no lagging.  However, the famous quickball has been removed.  For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed.  With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years.  So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions.  I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware.Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery.  The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. It also reduces the risk of load on charger circuit due to lower charging current and no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), so battery and peripheral components remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I preferred a thicker back cover.Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume.  But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use.The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up.Finally, Amazon delivery was on time.  Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+.  Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly.When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone.No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.UPDATE 2:We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type.  But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that.  So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced.  Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings.  If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024):The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily.  Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free.  Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt  default 'Messaging' app  I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control.  Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'.  A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones.  Quality of hardware is very good and performing.  With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features.  Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode.  I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory.  Only if needed, I will configure it.  I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024):A bug is identified on HyperOS.  When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made.  Incoming calls also do not get through.  I have tested this multiple times.  Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug.  Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally.  This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money.  Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range.  Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024):When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore.  A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date.  Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder.  Then restore that file.  While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre.  The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch.  I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell.  Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3.  Others can enjoy too.UPDATE 6.. For 6 GB/ 128 GB Version (31 July 2024):I have also bought the 6 GB/ 128 GB variant.  Having hardened the HyperOS, this phone is almost a stock android like with nil bloatware.  The usage time has increased since the memory utilisation has reduced and with it, the battery lasts slightly longer as compared to the 8 GB/ 256 GB variant.  You would notice that Xiaomi has released the Poco M6 plus and Redmi 13 5g variant last month using the same processor by little overclocking (they call it accelarated or AE) to 2.3 GHz instead of 2.2 GHz,  adding a 120 Hz display and 108 MP camera, etc with 35% higher price for 6GB/ 128GB.  Well, I am contented with the M6Pro 5g's price to performance since frying the CPU may reduce its life.Regards.....

As part of Samsung’s Galaxy M series, it targets users who want a reliable device without breaking the bank. This review covers the key aspects of the Galaxy M14 5G, including its design, display, performance, camera quality, battery life, and connectivity.**Design and Build QualityThe Samsung Galaxy M14 5G has a straightforward design that is functional and practical. The device features a polycarbonate back and frame, which contributes to its lightweight and durable build. The phone is available in various colors, adding a touch of personalization. While the plastic construction is typical for its price range, the overall build quality feels solid and capable of withstanding everyday wear and tear.The phone has a large 6.6-inch display, which is quite expansive for the price, making it well-suited for media consumption and gaming. The design is clean, with slim bezels around the display and a centrally positioned camera module on the rear.**DisplayThe Galaxy M14 5G sports a 6.6-inch PLS LCD display with a Full HD+ resolution. While it does not feature the high refresh rates found in more expensive models, the screen provides good color accuracy and adequate brightness for general use. The PLS LCD technology offers decent viewing angles and sufficient detail for everyday tasks. However, it might not be as vibrant or contrast-rich as AMOLED screens found in higher-end devices.**PerformancePowered by the Exynos 1330 chipset, the Galaxy M14 5G delivers competent performance for a budget phone. Coupled with 4GB of RAM, it handles everyday tasks such as web browsing, social media, and streaming with reasonable efficiency. Multitasking is smooth for light use, though users might experience some lag with more demanding applications or extensive multitasking.The phone comes with 128GB of internal storage, which is ample for most users. Additionally, it supports expandable storage via a microSD card, providing flexibility for those who need extra space for apps, media, and files.**Camera Quality**The Galaxy M14 5G features a triple camera setup on the rear, including a 50MP main sensor, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The main 50MP camera performs reasonably well in good lighting conditions, producing clear and detailed images. However, its performance in low light can be inconsistent, with photos sometimes lacking detail and clarity.The 2MP macro lens allows for close-up shots, though it can be limited in terms of focus and detail. The depth sensor helps with portrait photography by adding a bokeh effect, though results can vary depending on lighting and subject distance.On the front, the phone is equipped with a 13MP selfie camera that captures decent selfies. While it is sufficient for social media and video calls, it may not offer the same level of detail and clarity as higher-end models.**Battery Life**One of the notable features of the Galaxy M14 5G is its substantial 6000mAh battery. This large battery capacity ensures that the phone can comfortably last through a full day of moderate to heavy use. Users can expect reliable performance for tasks such as web browsing, streaming, and gaming. The battery life is a significant advantage, especially for users who prioritize longevity and do not want to charge their device frequently.**Connectivity and Software**The Galaxy M14 5G supports 5G connectivity, which is a plus for future-proofing and faster network speeds. It also includes other standard connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and GPS. The phone runs on Samsung’s One UI, based on Android, providing a user-friendly interface with various customization options.**Positive Aspects**1. **Large Display**: The 6.6-inch Full HD+ display is spacious and suitable for media consumption.2. **Impressive Battery Life**: The 6000mAh battery offers extended usage and reduces the need for frequent charging.3. **5G Connectivity**: Future-proofing with 5G support provides faster network speeds and enhanced connectivity.4. **Expandable Storage**: The option to use a microSD card adds flexibility for managing files and media.**Negative Aspects**1. **Average Display Quality**: The PLS LCD screen lacks the vibrancy and contrast of AMOLED displays found in higher-end models.2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup, while decent, struggles in low light and offers limited features compared to more advanced devices.3. **Performance Limitations**: The Exynos 1330 chipset and 4GB of RAM may struggle with more demanding applications or extensive multitasking.4. **Plastic Build**: While functional, the plastic construction may not feel as premium as glass or metal alternatives.**Conclusion**The Samsung Galaxy M14 5G is a solid choice for those seeking a budget smartphone with decent performance and modern features like 5G connectivity. It excels in battery life and offers a large display, making it suitable for everyday use. However, limitations in display quality, camera performance, and overall build may be drawbacks for some users. For its price, it provides good value, especially for those who prioritize battery life and connectivity.', 'Overall best mobile with all excellent features', ""First thing that I liked was the battery.

It handles daily tasks well thanks to the Exynos 1330 processor, though it may struggle with heavy multitasking or gaming. The phone's 50MP main camera performs decently in good lighting but falls short in low-light scenarios. While it promises long-term software support (2 years of OS updates, 4 years of security patches), it lacks a charger in the box and features a somewhat bulky plastic design.

There’s a bit of a learning curve, especially when it comes to using the hotkeys and understanding all the functions.

Hybrid SIM Slot Limitation:The phone does not support simultaneous use of dual SIMs and a microSD card. You can either use two SIM cards or one SIM card with one SD card. This limits the ability to expand storage if you need to use both SIMs, which in turn slows down the device due to restricted storage space.2. Poor Call Recording Quality:The call recording function is quite disappointing. The other person's voice is extremely low and almost inaudible, making it difficult to understand conversations. In contrast, your own voice is recorded very loudly, which makes the playback experience irritating, especially in normal listening conditions.3. Performance Issues Within a Week:Despite minimal usage—no gaming, heavy apps, WhatsApp, or even photos—the phone has started hanging within just a week of usage. This raises concerns about its long-term reliability and performance optimization.4. Display Quality:The screen resolution is noticeably poor. Text appears fuzzy, giving the feel of a very low-resolution display. This significantly affects the viewing and reading experience and could have been improved.Conclusion:While I’m not completely rejecting the Tecno Pop 9—it does serve the purpose for very basic needs—I believe some features fall short when compared to older basic models like the Samsung M01 Duo, which despite being several years old, offers better screen clarity and call recording quality.For users who don’t rely heavily on call recording, multitasking, or display clarity, the Tecno Pop 9 might still be a decent budget-friendly option.

Make sure you check where the seals areDo check how a phone should look when turning on for the first time. It should have a welcome or hello screen or something similar.When delivery driver comes, check all of these points and turn on the phone but don't put sim card in yet until you are happy with the phone.Check camera, speaker or what is important to you. You can ask chatgpt for help too.If you aren't free at home, ask a friend or someone trusted to check the phone for you and record the delivery if possible and if some defects happen, reject the delivery.Sometimes sellers give you second hand even though you asked for a new product, so do check during delivery.

Unfortunately there is no manual to speak of (there is one, but all it talks about is how to separately store the battery, which can't even be removed!). They don't even tell you how to install a SIM card! Took me over half an hour to figure it out. Then I had to spend 2-3 hours with the phone's in-built 'set up' procedure. Even though I kept replying 'No' to most things. They have a license agreement for using the phone! I think that would be pretty important to tell a buyer ~before~ the purchase, wouldn't you think?After the very tedious set up, I spent another 2 hours deleting all bloatware. All the stupid apps that the phone wanted to force on me.Since then the phone has performed admirably. The battery life is fantastic. It lasts for 24 hours even with continuous hotspot usage. Older phones couldn't make it past 3-4 hours! The phone does not heat up at all while charging, whereas another phone from a very reputed brand would overheat within one hour. It automatically cuts off charging when the battery is full -- for now this is a good thing, but I don't know how it will behave in a year or so when the battery's overall life deteriorates. Camera and display are crisp.

Hybrid SIM Slot Limitation:The phone does not support simultaneous use of dual SIMs and a microSD card. You can either use two SIM cards or one SIM card with one SD card. This limits the ability to expand storage if you need to use both SIMs, which in turn slows down the device due to restricted storage space.2. Poor Call Recording Quality:The call recording function is quite disappointing. The other person's voice is extremely low and almost inaudible, making it difficult to understand conversations. In contrast, your own voice is recorded very loudly, which makes the playback experience irritating, especially in normal listening conditions.3. Performance Issues Within a Week:Despite minimal usage—no gaming, heavy apps, WhatsApp, or even photos—the phone has started hanging within just a week of usage. This raises concerns about its long-term reliability and performance optimization.4. Display Quality:The screen resolution is noticeably poor. Text appears fuzzy, giving the feel of a very low-resolution display. This significantly affects the viewing and reading experience and could have been improved.Conclusion:While I’m not completely rejecting the Tecno Pop 9—it does serve the purpose for very basic needs—I believe some features fall short when compared to older basic models like the Samsung M01 Duo, which despite being several years old, offers better screen clarity and call recording quality.For users who don’t rely heavily on call recording, multitasking, or display clarity, the Tecno Pop 9 might still be a decent budget-friendly option.

Unfortunately there is no manual to speak of (there is one, but all it talks about is how to separately store the battery, which can't even be removed!). They don't even tell you how to install a SIM card! Took me over half an hour to figure it out. Then I had to spend 2-3 hours with the phone's in-built 'set up' procedure. Even though I kept replying 'No' to most things. They have a license agreement for using the phone! I think that would be pretty important to tell a buyer ~before~ the purchase, wouldn't you think?After the very tedious set up, I spent another 2 hours deleting all bloatware. All the stupid apps that the phone wanted to force on me.Since then the phone has performed admirably. The battery life is fantastic. It lasts for 24 hours even with continuous hotspot usage. Older phones couldn't make it past 3-4 hours! The phone does not heat up at all while charging, whereas another phone from a very reputed brand would overheat within one hour. It automatically cuts off charging when the battery is full -- for now this is a good thing, but I don't know how it will behave in a year or so when the battery's overall life deteriorates. Camera and display are crisp. The camera software comes with many presets and I've found a couple of them to be quite useful to get good quality photos.I don't use this phone to play high-end games so I don't know how it will function for intense requirements, but I suspect it may do just fine. For the price though, it seems like the best phone to buy if you can get through the very confusing and tedious set up process, or get someone to help you through it. I understand that they want to minimise costs and not produce an expensive printed manual, but at least they could have pointed us to a link on the internet where we could have got detailed directions for installing SIM cards, microSD cards, setting up the phone, etc. And that they had shown me the license agreement before I paid for the damn thing!"", 'Phone is top notch as per the price segment.

Display to body ratio very high, gives a very premium look with the flat display3. Snapdragon 8 gen 3 is OP, with adaptive frame booster, game runs at constant 120fps even with HDR settings.4. Battery easily last 2 days even with heavy usage, if used less it lasts 3 days.5. Camera is good, don't know why oneplus was known for bad camera, yeah it slightly over processed the photos, but it's still pleasing to eyes, if you don't want that you can turn on natural mode, and reduces the saturation to make it look natural.6. 120hz display of this feels a lot smoother than other phones with 120hz like samsung s24, iphone 14 pro etc. oneplus 13 is even more smoother than this phone.7.

AI features are also very good.9. Zero heating issues, even gaming cannot do anything more than just warming up the phone.Cons:1. Charging speed could have been better, the last 11r and 12r charges faster with 100w charger, but this one supports only 80w, take 1 hr to fully charge2. Telephoto lens has different color calibration compared to main lens, though it's not reflected while recording videos.3.

Metal frames gets hot while charging, which is good as it dissipates heat better than plastic.6. Oneplus has set the phone to limit performance when phone crosses 42° C, hence you don't get better scores in antutu, however if you do something to keep the phone below 38° C it gives impressive scores on antutu, when I tested, I got a 19.5 million score with high performance mode and phone touching 41 °C, however some youtubers show the phone scoring 21.5 million which is possible if phone has something to remove its heat.Overall, you can't find better refined phone in the whole 30k to 50k range. Just go for this phone.You don't have to worry about green line issues cause oneplus this time started using BOE X2 premium display which has better quality than samsung display which was the reason for green line issues. Also oneplus is the only brand to give life time warranty for green line issues.JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE"", ""No phone can be rated 5 out of 5. At the best 4.5 would be possible with something or the other falling short in a practical sense.Oneplus 13R has many great things under it's hood but half heartedly done to retain the difference between R and the non R phone.A. Positives.1. Display.Excellent and flat display. No concerns as it now comes with life time warranty for green line issues, if any and if at all which is a great peace of mind considering Oneplus would honour it. Supports Dolby vision, HDR +. The display is bright, clear and crisp. The under display optical finger print sensor is placed lower closer to the bottom bezel failing to the ergonomic placement. It could have been an inch above. However, no issues with it's operations. Quite quick but not as fast and quick as ultra sonic sensor.2. Processor.Excellent. No lags and no hiccups. (I am not into gaming but i know this would fare well based on my experience with S24 Ultra. Note that there would be heating felt upon prolonged heavy app use. However, this SoC would serve well for several years with new android updates. Now with Oneplus offering 4 plus 6 years SW update policy this is future proof hardware.3. Sound.Ok, the stereo sound is decent and loud enough but there's evident distortion over 90 percent volume setting. Bass isn't very evident. Also Dolby Atmos is now not available. Otherwise it's a proper stereo sounding speakers.4. RAM, Storage and Communication.Excellent specs with DDR5 and UFS 4.0. With base version starting at 12GB/256GB it's more than enough for most users. It is however let down with USB 2.0 post that limits transfer speeds but then it's something that wouldn't bother to most people who wouldn't be transferring data to and fro from other devices. IP protection is IP65 which is fine but IP 68 is a common thing at these prices especially from chinese phone makers. Haptics are tight but weak. A little more stronger motor would have been perfect.5. Battery.Excellent. Anything between 7 to 10 hours of SOT can easily be had from this phone. A proper full day battery unless you are into gaming all the day. I use 50 percent for my use case which involves social media, few camera photos and browsing with about 4 hours of SOT. Calling drains faster than multimedia watching which probably needs to be rectified with future updates. Some carrier bands seems to have been removed, however I didn't have any issues with calling or internet on my 4G airtel SIM. There's no wireless charging though.6. Call qualityVery good and clear. No issues at either end..signal reception is also good.B. Negatives.1. SoftwareThis is Color OS 15 which is slightly modified as Oxygen OS 15. It's super smooth and slick with lots of customizations possible. But still it's no where near Samsung One UI which is far superior, functional and feature rich than Oxygen OS 15. Also Oneplus added few bloatwares like Phone manager, Phone pick and few other apps. Luckily, you can either uninstall them or disable them.Interestingly, as an example the biggest overlooked setting is you can chose when to enter Power saving mode but you can come out of it only when you charge it till 90 percent. This is something that's silly and Oneplus must automatically disable power saving mode once the battery crosses it's trigger point. There are couple of such thoughtless things in Oxygen OS 15 which should be rectified. There's also nothing like Routines which Samsung offers on their S and A series for phone automation tasks.2. CamerasSome changes are positive but half hearted. Something like adding a telephoto 2X instead of macro which is such a welcome move, but then this lens has no OIS. UW 8 MP is just passable in daylight. In day light both main and 2X give good quality photos however low light performance is much to be desired. 3X with OIS would be more practical as such. Video on this phone is even more compromised with 4K limited to main sensor. All other sensors are capped at 1080P. In the front 16 MP camera is again okish for photos and handicapped for videos capped at 1080, 30 FPS which is a bummer. Overall Oneplus could have done better with the cameras but it seems like they intentionally subdued R series more to differentiate it with the pricier Oneplus 13 rather than on pricing front.3. AIThere are few AI features in photos, notes etc..but frankly they don't work as seamlessly or effectively as what can be seen on my S24U from Samsung. Oneplus has a long way to go in this aspect. Right now it's more gimmicky.My last Oneplus phone was 3T post which I switched to Samsung S series. No doubt S series,  especially Ultra is leagues ahead both hardware and software but when it comes to value for money Oneplus 13 series does shine. Moreso with their introductory pricing and offers. Yes some of the above shortcomings could have been included at this price point, but stills it's a safe bet and a promising phone for years of use with the kind of hardware and SW you get from Oneplus.I would recommend the Oneplus 13R phone under 40K for its hardware and revised SW update policy.

There are more pros in device than cons and I must say no other phone can beat this in this particular price segment.Design and Build (9/10)-The phone feels quite sleek and comfortable in hand. Weighing just about 180g and about 7.5mm thick. This phone is by far the slimmest and lightest 5500Mah phone I have ever seen. Even slimmer and slighter than many 5000Mah phone is the market. Ther design language is taken from newly launched Vivo v40 series and this phone is exact replica or little toned down version of Vivo V40e. So you are getting a 28k V40e phone under 20k. A sweet deal right.Display(8.5/10) -- The display is a typical 120Hz, Oled panel with deep black and around 1000 nits of peak brightness which is more than enough in outdoor environment. Colours are punchy and crisp. You get different colour modes which you can set as per your taste.Camera (9/10)-  Camera is just outstanding. I have never seen such an amazing low light performance from any 15-20k phones in the recent times. The camera balances light very well and even in backlite situation the photos are amazing. The 2x potraits are awesome coupled with various background bokeh modes. Colours are good and dynamic range is fantastic. This phone is camera beast in 18k and I must say Well done Iqoo. They focused on giving 1 very good camera rather than two or three average cameras. Many brands give useless 8MP wide angle camera and mediocre primary camera in this range. If wide angle is your priority than you can go with Iqoo z9s pro model.Performance(9/10)--This phone can handle days to day task very smoothly with no zitter or lag. Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.Battery (10/10)--Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.Software and other features (7/10)--The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added."", 'First time I purchase iqoo z9s mobile to be honest I m very happy for everything in this mobile every feature is so cool and comfortable and also looks very beautiful and stunning, very slim and very much pretty...5g runs very well, camera quality is superb❤️❤️❤️💯perfact for everyone who want to purchase this mobile...Mera to best ever phone hai ye 🥰😍', 'Hello.

Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.Battery (10/10)--Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.Software and other features (7/10)--The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added."", 'First time I purchase iqoo z9s mobile to be honest I m very happy for everything in this mobile every feature is so cool and comfortable and also looks very beautiful and stunning, very slim and very much pretty...5g runs very well, camera quality is superb❤️❤️❤️💯perfact for everyone who want to purchase this mobile...Mera to best ever phone hai ye 🥰😍', 'Hello.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.', 'Phone features are aside, the best thing is One Plus give always the complete package.

Worth the money. The display, large screen and smooth function is great.However my experience with Amazon was pathetic. Delivery was 8 days even after it had arrived in station. The delivery agent would give a missed call and immediately after I would receive a msg saying the customer is not available/ contactable. The issue was escalated twice and still no reason has been given for the delay except for the standard apologies.Recommend purchase high value items directly from the company's online purchase website."", 'Very nice product and all features. The seller is also prompt and active. The only problem is the delivery agents, pls look into these persons. They deliberately do not call us and simply say that visited your house found no body, so come and collect from their point, else we are returning your products. They showed time to visit my house at 11:30 pm in night.

Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer."", 'Great experience to all performanceDisplay 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 5/5Best processor in segmentCamera awesome pictureThis is a good option for all one person found this helpful😎😎😊 Dame true experience to all use Mobile features', ""I'm blown away by how fast this phone is. Runs mostly game at max settings without heating up. The 144Hz screen is super smooth, and the design feels premium despite being plastic. Totally worth it for gamers! The AMOLED display is bright and colorful, and everything feels very fluid. Funtouch OS is much improved. Only downside – camera could be better in very low light, but it's fine for daily use."", 'Everything is good but the selfie camera is extremely bad .A 7k phone has  better selfie camera then this.The speaker is ok but some video and audio sound hurts a little to hear , the whats app video call quality is also extremely poor even a 6k phone will perform better. App install and update speed is not optimize properly even after 3 months', 'I’ve got this for my wife and she is using the iQOO Neo 10R 5G (Moonlight variant) for a few weeks now, and it’s been an impressive experience overall. The performance is blazing fast — apps load instantly, multitasking is smooth, and gaming is lag-free thanks to the Snapdragon chipset. Screen size is 6.78 Amoled display so it give great experience watching online content. It has ample storage capacity so can store multiple pictures and videos.The display is crisp, vibrant, and perfect for streaming or gaming. Battery life easily lasts a full day, and the fast charging is a real time-saver. The Moonlight finish looks sleek and premium — definitely stands out.If I had to nitpick, I’d say the phone feels slightly on the heavier side, especially during prolonged use. But honestly, it’s a small trade-off for the build quality and features packed in.For the price, this is a powerful, stylish phone that punches well above its weight. Great buy!']","Camera, Performance & Display",0.1607142857142857,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610NUM9jlxL._SX679_.jpg

Zero lag, nor in gaming (I am talking about heavy gaming 90-120 fps) neither day to day uses. Smooth and crisp display. Charging is superfast (0-100 in 38 minutes). Homescreen, lock screen effects cam be customized easily. Can even play upto 144 fps in certain games. Has monster mode(voice changer, background calls,split screen etc) but heats slightly when gaming on high environment temp. With 90-120 fps gaming, it heats significantly.

If you are a guy with optimum usage no games and all or you are a guy with heavy games and editing, it will be a butter smooth experience , not tried 144fps will update later .one thing is 2.4 million antutu score is experienced only on 16gb variant not on all devices mentioned in their website itself I felt to share with you all.BGMI : first of all there is no such fps shifting from 120 to 90 so pls don't believe on that rumour, second thing bgmi runs like butter on both 90 and 120 fps and no such noticable heatings even after 5 hrs or more gaming. Talking about battery, per tdm costs 1% battery, 1 hr of proper chicken dinner classic match will drain upto 10-15% battery, mine lasts 30-40 mins and it drain 9-10% which is good for me . There is no poor screen recordings so feel free to buy for bgmiBattery: it comes with 7000mah and with 120 w adapter, normal use lasts for 2 days with 12hr+ screen time and bgmi will run approx 8-9 hrs I have not tested it but played 5-6 hrs straight and it went upto 35 % u can expect more 2-3 hrs easily. Charging speed is really fast and exactly what iqoo claims so no worries about that .Camera : camera is good tbh not a camera centric but compared it with iqoo z9s , moto edge 50 fusion and vivo v40 too of my family members. Images are far better than z9s and edge 50 fusion but not so good as vivo v40 and u can expect that but video quality is on next level it's actually blew me its better than all other three . I will advise use 4k30fpsDisplay: colour full and bright. No problem in using it under direct Sunlight peak brightness is osm .IR blaster is really amazing works perfectly but only thing which lacking in this device is IP rating and titanium colour is actually amazing but I feel it's not giving that premium quality being a 36k phone could have been better. I will suggest those who are searching here for a premium phone with day today normal work , camera and display can go for vivo v40 or pro versionOverall this phone is totally value for money, so happy that I got a device which I really wanted to seen couple of stupid reviews and was changing my decision took a risk and it's worth it . One thing to mention is your fps will drop to 60 fps only when you are on battery saver mode before starting the game or at 75% once you change the fps setting again or disable the battery saver mode you are on 👍.

Great look & feel and good build quality.2. Fantastic display- very big with minimal bezels and great colors and sharpness. Brightness in direct sunlight is pretty good.3. Great cameras- Very natural colors and skin tones, with plenty of detail. Good color consistency between the two lenses. Ultrawide is obviously less sharp, but gets the job done. Portrait mode is the champion feature here. DSLR like shots, especially in the 2x mode. Low light photos are quite good and sharp too, but with less accurate white balance. Selfie camera also is amazing with high level of detail and good skin tones. Video clarity is also amazing, with surprisingly good zoom details.4. Excellent Audio- sound quality from the dual speakers is amazing with surprising amount of bass, clarity and stereo separation. Also mic recording quality is excellent, records in stereo as it has dual mics.5. Good Call quality - absolutely no problems. Its great.6. Network - Was getting network pretty much everywhere I travelled and good thing is that internet speed was pretty good even in traffic situations.7. Fantastic Battery life and charging-  After proper full charge, Lasts almost two dayson normal usage. Stand by is amazing, lost only 2-3% whole night. On heavy usage, easily can reach the next day with 2-3 hours worth of charge left.It is a charging beast, completes charging from 0 to 100 in 30-35 minutes, great for busy days. But make sure to keep the charging on until you receive a battery charge completed notification, otherwise you will experience slightly faster battery discharge.8. Fantastic Performance- Handles daily tasks like its nothing. I am not a gamer, but usually I tend to open and use multiple apps at once, like teams, uber, ola, maps and youtube music, and the phone doesn't break a sweat, handles it like a champ. Apps also open really fast. Observed little to no bugs or lags.9. Nice extras-Great premium haptic feedback nicely integrated with the UI.IR blaster is a nice addition.Bumper case included in the box is pretty nice with raised corners to protect the display, but can get dirty and attract stains pretty easily.3 months of additional warranty.Fast delivery by amazon.Cons-1. Video stabilization is not that great, can be improved.2. Zoom shots have too much contrast and appear a little too artificial, you actually see better details in view finder before taking the photo.3. Slow photo processing. If you take a moving shot or a burst shot, it will skip processing to freeze the action and will not have the same quality as a fully processed image.4. No official display protection. Some websites specify it is a panda glass, but still better to have a tempered screen guard.5. No headphone jack, which is a bummer. Should have in this price range.6. Missing app-opening animations, making the UI feel basic.7. Only 2 years of OS updates. It should be minimum 3 in this price range.8. No official IP rating, although it can handle small splashes of water drops and dust. At this price, it should be at least official.Conclusion-If you want a reliable all-rounder, you can easily go for Nord CE 4. I am fully satisfied with my purchase.

It is so clean and smooth. Nothing OS has become my favourite UI now. The optimization that Nothing has done with their phones is just amazing. UI feels so smooth to use, lots of customisation features and overall feels polished.The phone is surprisingly light and comfortable to hold. I love the design so much and the uniform bezels at the front is just the cherry on top. It's a 6.7 inch phone but it doesn't feel large to hold which is a good thing. The back is a fingerprint magnet though so you'd need a case or just apply a membrane on the back if you like your phone case free. But use a case with a membrane if you want to resell it in the future.The battery life is amazing too. If you don't game too much it'll last you a day and a half which I have personally experienced, 6- 9 hours of screen on time. No charger inside the box so I'd recommend getting the original Samsung 25 watt which costs around 1k. It charges the phone under an hour. You can also get the cmf 65 watt charger but it's on the pricer side.The cameras are surprisingly good too, not the best but gets the job done.You get stereo speakers and they're pretty loud too. I've seen better speakers on Motorola phones but it is not bad either. Haptics are decent too.I've experienced no issues with the network connectivity, I'm getting 5G++ in my area and the 5G range is amazing too.Overall, it's a good all round phone. It doesn't beat the competition in the price range but it provides a good all-round package. Highly recommended if you want an amazing software experience and design."", ""Why did you pick this product vs others?:I was really impressed by Nothing's software experience, so that's y i chose this model.

It looks super clean and aesthetic, definitely stands out in the crowd. The processor is smooth and handles daily tasks easily. You can do some average gaming too without any major issues. It’s well-optimised and doesn’t feel like it’ll go outdated too quickly.The camera is quite good, even the nighttime shots come out nicely. Only thing is the front camera could be a little better in low light. Also, the back panel tends to catch scratches if you don’t use a case  so that’s something to watch out for.Overall, for ₹22,000, it’s a solid deal. Great design, good performance, and worth the price.', ""I've been using the Nothing Phone 2 for a while now, and overall, it's a solid device. The design is definitely eye-catching with the transparent back and Glyph Interface – it stands out from the crowd. The display is crisp and smooth, and the overall user experience feels clean and minimal, staying true to the brand's aesthetic.Performance-wise, it handles everyday tasks well and offers a pretty good gaming experience too. Battery life is decent, lasting a full day with moderate use. The camera setup does a good job in daylight, although there's still some room for improvement in low-light photography.What I like most is the unique design and the bloat-free software experience.

Battery life decent for moderate users, easily lasts one day, display quality and hdr performance is very good. Camera is decent, details are good but processing needs improvement. Sound quality is rich but lack in bass. And lastly the performance of the phone is good according to the price, mind that it is not a gaming or high performance targetting device, it is for regular day to day work and overall user experience targetting phone , so don't expect more like heavy gaming or editing or rendering. Purchase it for regular moderate using, a little bit gaming(sometimes), calling or video chatting, regular work like browsing, media or content watching, social media scrolling, occasionally photography and many more like that. Just enjoy the user experience and in hand feel, though it is little heavy, specially after allowing the back cover.And lastly the glyph interface is fun to use. One thing I want to clarify that as it is not come with an adapter in the box, so if you can afford the original adapter by adding more 2.5k with its price, then blindly go for that but if you r not capable to spend that much money for the charger then be aware with buying other 3rd party adapter or other phone chargers, because it supports pd or pps charging with aronund 20V-2.5 ampere current, some pd chargers are 15V-3 ampere , which will not support the fast charging with this device. So, while buying a new 3rd party charger or using other chargers, please mind this information and check the output before buying. Otherwise it will charge very slow. That's all guys.

I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace)Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful.As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.3) Battery: (8/10)It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal.5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.4) Display: (8/10)It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10)I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective)This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.Overall: (8.25)It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future."", '✅ Positive Review Points:1. Design & Build Quality:OnePlus Nord 4 design chala premium ga undi.

I am coming from A52s phone - I have used flagship phones too but I realized they are overkill for my usage so I stopped buying expensive phones. Here are my thoughts on A55:1) Display - Less vibrant than previous A series phones as far as colors are concerned. This display produces more natural colors & I think this is good. No outdoor visibility issues. Bezels are a bit thicker but the quality of display compensates for that. Give it some time you will forget bezels.2) Sound - Nothing to complain, they do their job quite well - both top and bottom speakers sound equal quality & volume wise.3) Network & connectivity - Call quality very good, I was a bit concerned it might have problems with network strength as many people complain of Exynos based phones, fortunately this doesn't have any issues at least where I live and go  - note that I use LTE only mode and not 5G. I would get better idea when I will encounter low network areas. Wifi is also solid, Samsung gave dual band antennas unlike A52s which had single band - due to which speed was limited to 50mbps on wifi - glad the A55 gives full wifi speeds! Bluetooth works well as expected. When I connect my amplifier through bluetooth the phone automatically choose Aptx codec. LDAC codec is also supported if you have LDAC device. A52s was limited to AAC.4) Build and in-hand feel - We are getting such premium quality hardware in lower priced phones is big thumbs up. The phone is little heavy but you will get used to it. The back glass is slippery to hold in hand - you will definitely need case or at least a skin for better grip.5) Software - Transfering data from A52s to A55 was breeze with Samsung smart switch app, I transferred 50gb+ data around 15 mins via usb c to c offline - it retained all settings too! For Whatsapp - I had to manually transfer (You can copy whatsapp folder from old phone to new phone and when you go to activate whatsapp it will ask you to restore that data. Only lost 1 day of data, otherwise everything transferred successfully).About One UI - Probably best software experience with tons of features and customization options! Got Android 15 based One UI 7 just on 21st May a few days back. Samsung is late with Android update this year because Google released Android 16 developer builds quite early last year so Samsung had to work simultaneously on both 15 & 16. They have proven track record of timely updates and I think they will get it right soon. Only major android update came late but security patches have been timely. 4 OS and upto 5 years of security updates makes this phone future proof, you will be good till 2029!6) Battery - It's too good! Check screenshot I get 10+ hours sot. It's easy 2+ days backup for me on normal apps usage. As I just updated to One UI 7 it's in learning mode, I am expecting improvement. I will update the review. For charging I use my old 15w Samsung charger which charges 15-100% in 1:30 hrs. 25w charger should do full charge in 1 hour.7) Performance - Exynos 1480 is no slouch, it performs admirably without any major hiccups. I had some occassional slutters in One ui 6.1 but after one UI 7 it has improved - the overall experience is smoother, more responsive. This is not performance oriented phone so if you multitask a lot, play heavy games then look for other phones. For normal user this is more than enough. No heating at all - it hardly gets warm!8) Camera - I haven't used camera enough to share any judgement but initial impressions are quite positive. Check Youtube videos for better idea - I did and I liked what all of the cameras offer. Nothing to complain.9) Price & value - It was launched at ₹40K last year in March 24, I bought for ₹23700 in recent summer sale. It's always best to avoid buying at launch and wait for price drop next year.Overall A55 is a balanced phone that doesn't lack in any aspect & it's possibly the best VFM phone from Samsung right now!--Suggestions to get best performance & battery backup:1) Use LTE only network mode instead of 5g or automatic.2) Disable wifi, bluetooth, location scanning features and use them only when needed.3) Remove unnecessary apps and disable features you don't use.4) Settings - Google - All Service - disable data sharing features like usage & diagnostics etc.5) Disable Google contact sync. Manually synch it when needed so it won't drain battery in background.This should be enough to improve battery for most users.For advance users - you can get 20-30% more improvement in battery and noticeable performance increment by debloating. Check xdaforums for safe to remove and safe to disable One UI apps & services list."", ""I chose the Galaxy A55 bcz I got it at\xa0 ₹25,500 and it offered a great balance of build quality, software, and performance at a fair price. It felt more premium and reliable compared to others in the same range.Performance & DisplayPerformance is smooth , and it only heats slightly during charging and gaming simultaneously—nothing serious.

With Launching of A56 price had dropped by over 10K. It is still worth, recently got One UI 7 and Android 15 upgrade. Camera and battery quality are both good.I ordered with exchange however the delivery person deliberately found scratches on screen and phone. I don't understand Amazon exchange policy. If they are expecting box pack mobile then why not pay full price of old model rather than 500 or 1000 rupees. This was my 3rd experience where Amazon rejected exchange. Amazon seriously need to set clear guidelines for exchange and be transparent in their policy.

I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace)Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful.As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.3) Battery: (8/10)It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal.5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.4) Display: (8/10)It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10)I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective)This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.Overall: (8.25)It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future."", '✅ Positive Review Points:1. Design & Build Quality:OnePlus Nord 4 design chala premium ga undi.

Great look & feel and good build quality.2. Fantastic display- very big with minimal bezels and great colors and sharpness. Brightness in direct sunlight is pretty good.3. Great cameras- Very natural colors and skin tones, with plenty of detail. Good color consistency between the two lenses. Ultrawide is obviously less sharp, but gets the job done. Portrait mode is the champion feature here. DSLR like shots, especially in the 2x mode. Low light photos are quite good and sharp too, but with less accurate white balance. Selfie camera also is amazing with high level of detail and good skin tones. Video clarity is also amazing, with surprisingly good zoom details.4. Excellent Audio- sound quality from the dual speakers is amazing with surprising amount of bass, clarity and stereo separation. Also mic recording quality is excellent, records in stereo as it has dual mics.5. Good Call quality - absolutely no problems. Its great.6. Network - Was getting network pretty much everywhere I travelled and good thing is that internet speed was pretty good even in traffic situations.7. Fantastic Battery life and charging-  After proper full charge, Lasts almost two dayson normal usage. Stand by is amazing, lost only 2-3% whole night. On heavy usage, easily can reach the next day with 2-3 hours worth of charge left.It is a charging beast, completes charging from 0 to 100 in 30-35 minutes, great for busy days. But make sure to keep the charging on until you receive a battery charge completed notification, otherwise you will experience slightly faster battery discharge.8. Fantastic Performance- Handles daily tasks like its nothing. I am not a gamer, but usually I tend to open and use multiple apps at once, like teams, uber, ola, maps and youtube music, and the phone doesn't break a sweat, handles it like a champ. Apps also open really fast. Observed little to no bugs or lags.9. Nice extras-Great premium haptic feedback nicely integrated with the UI.IR blaster is a nice addition.Bumper case included in the box is pretty nice with raised corners to protect the display, but can get dirty and attract stains pretty easily.3 months of additional warranty.Fast delivery by amazon.Cons-1. Video stabilization is not that great, can be improved.2. Zoom shots have too much contrast and appear a little too artificial, you actually see better details in view finder before taking the photo.3. Slow photo processing. If you take a moving shot or a burst shot, it will skip processing to freeze the action and will not have the same quality as a fully processed image.4. No official display protection. Some websites specify it is a panda glass, but still better to have a tempered screen guard.5. No headphone jack, which is a bummer. Should have in this price range.6. Missing app-opening animations, making the UI feel basic.7. Only 2 years of OS updates. It should be minimum 3 in this price range.8. No official IP rating, although it can handle small splashes of water drops and dust. At this price, it should be at least official.Conclusion-If you want a reliable all-rounder, you can easily go for Nord CE 4. I am fully satisfied with my purchase.

Zero lag, nor in gaming (I am talking about heavy gaming 90-120 fps) neither day to day uses. Smooth and crisp display. Charging is superfast (0-100 in 38 minutes). Homescreen, lock screen effects cam be customized easily. Can even play upto 144 fps in certain games. Has monster mode(voice changer, background calls,split screen etc) but heats slightly when gaming on high environment temp. With 90-120 fps gaming, it heats significantly. For gaming- cooler temperatures are required.Build quality is OK, Plastic Body. IP65 rated (dust and splash proof only.) Shoud have been at least IP37, IP38.', ""Got 12gb  titanium variant on 16 june , here's my 1 week review:PROCESSOR: being a midnight gamer and a student the processor is what I will love the most , trust me not a single complaint. If you are a guy with optimum usage no games and all or you are a guy with heavy games and editing, it will be a butter smooth experience , not tried 144fps will update later .one thing is 2.4 million antutu score is experienced only on 16gb variant not on all devices mentioned in their website itself I felt to share with you all.BGMI : first of all there is no such fps shifting from 120 to 90 so pls don't believe on that rumour, second thing bgmi runs like butter on both 90 and 120 fps and no such noticable heatings even after 5 hrs or more gaming. Talking about battery, per tdm costs 1% battery, 1 hr of proper chicken dinner classic match will drain upto 10-15% battery, mine lasts 30-40 mins and it drain 9-10% which is good for me . There is no poor screen recordings so feel free to buy for bgmiBattery: it comes with 7000mah and with 120 w adapter, normal use lasts for 2 days with 12hr+ screen time and bgmi will run approx 8-9 hrs I have not tested it but played 5-6 hrs straight and it went upto 35 % u can expect more 2-3 hrs easily. Charging speed is really fast and exactly what iqoo claims so no worries about that .Camera : camera is good tbh not a camera centric but compared it with iqoo z9s , moto edge 50 fusion and vivo v40 too of my family members. Images are far better than z9s and edge 50 fusion but not so good as vivo v40 and u can expect that but video quality is on next level it's actually blew me its better than all other three . I will advise use 4k30fpsDisplay: colour full and bright. No problem in using it under direct Sunlight peak brightness is osm .IR blaster is really amazing works perfectly but only thing which lacking in this device is IP rating and titanium colour is actually amazing but I feel it's not giving that premium quality being a 36k phone could have been better. I will suggest those who are searching here for a premium phone with day today normal work , camera and display can go for vivo v40 or pro versionOverall this phone is totally value for money, so happy that I got a device which I really wanted to seen couple of stupid reviews and was changing my decision took a risk and it's worth it . One thing to mention is your fps will drop to 60 fps only when you are on battery saver mode before starting the game or at 75% once you change the fps setting again or disable the battery saver mode you are on 👍. I will surely share some clips and images if you find this review helpful"", 'Battery and charging speed is unmatchable, unbeatable and really really good. I have not seen this capacity of battery and this speed of charging.Camera is having pros also and cons also, like in low light this camera is performing better than apple. Then in potraits photo this camera is stunning and unbeatable. Yes because this a 50mp camera so you can not take heavy zooming photos like Samsung. The wide angle photos and vedios are very poor if you compare with Samsung and apple.Performance is decent because of the Snapdragon 8s Gen4 but also this phone has features to make you feel more faster user experience. I have not seen any phone installing the applications faster than this phone.Display is big and bright. But there is a missing premium feel of touch. Which Samsung gives.I was a Samsung user since last 10 years so I can say that.Every thing else is awesome. This is best mobile phone in this price range. Yes there is a competitor of this phone also which is poco F7.I have uploaded some camera samples also.Himanshu Singh', ""For Gamers, it's a gem of a phone. But you have to keep touch sampling rate as 'Recommended'. If kept as 'High', the battery will drain faster. You will get 110-120 fps on average for BGMI. Camera is above expectation being a gaming phone. For someone who prefers zoomed photography, it's not that good since it doesn't have periscope camera. Otherwise, it takes really good photos. UI is good but could be better. Brightness is also good with features like eye-protection. Sound quantity is also nice and loud, though Dolby Atmos support is not provided. Worth recommended phone unless you are a hardcore photography enthusiastic."", ""It's best for performance, battery and charging.

In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer."", 'Great experience to all performanceDisplay 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 5/5Best processor in segmentCamera awesome pictureThis is a good option for all one person found this helpful😎😎😊 Dame true experience to all use Mobile features', ""I'm blown away by how fast this phone is. Runs mostly game at max settings without heating up. The 144Hz screen is super smooth, and the design feels premium despite being plastic. Totally worth it for gamers! The AMOLED display is bright and colorful, and everything feels very fluid. Funtouch OS is much improved. Only downside – camera could be better in very low light, but it's fine for daily use."", 'Everything is good but the selfie camera is extremely bad .A 7k phone has  better selfie camera then this.The speaker is ok but some video and audio sound hurts a little to hear , the whats app video call quality is also extremely poor even a 6k phone will perform better. App install and update speed is not optimize properly even after 3 months', 'I’ve got this for my wife and she is using the iQOO Neo 10R 5G (Moonlight variant) for a few weeks now, and it’s been an impressive experience overall. The performance is blazing fast — apps load instantly, multitasking is smooth, and gaming is lag-free thanks to the Snapdragon chipset. Screen size is 6.78 Amoled display so it give great experience watching online content. It has ample storage capacity so can store multiple pictures and videos.The display is crisp, vibrant, and perfect for streaming or gaming. Battery life easily lasts a full day, and the fast charging is a real time-saver. The Moonlight finish looks sleek and premium — definitely stands out.If I had to nitpick, I’d say the phone feels slightly on the heavier side, especially during prolonged use. But honestly, it’s a small trade-off for the build quality and features packed in.For the price, this is a powerful, stylish phone that punches well above its weight.

I am coming from A52s phone - I have used flagship phones too but I realized they are overkill for my usage so I stopped buying expensive phones. Here are my thoughts on A55:1) Display - Less vibrant than previous A series phones as far as colors are concerned. This display produces more natural colors & I think this is good. No outdoor visibility issues. Bezels are a bit thicker but the quality of display compensates for that. Give it some time you will forget bezels.2) Sound - Nothing to complain, they do their job quite well - both top and bottom speakers sound equal quality & volume wise.3) Network & connectivity - Call quality very good, I was a bit concerned it might have problems with network strength as many people complain of Exynos based phones, fortunately this doesn't have any issues at least where I live and go  - note that I use LTE only mode and not 5G. I would get better idea when I will encounter low network areas. Wifi is also solid, Samsung gave dual band antennas unlike A52s which had single band - due to which speed was limited to 50mbps on wifi - glad the A55 gives full wifi speeds! Bluetooth works well as expected. When I connect my amplifier through bluetooth the phone automatically choose Aptx codec. LDAC codec is also supported if you have LDAC device. A52s was limited to AAC.4) Build and in-hand feel - We are getting such premium quality hardware in lower priced phones is big thumbs up. The phone is little heavy but you will get used to it. The back glass is slippery to hold in hand - you will definitely need case or at least a skin for better grip.5) Software - Transfering data from A52s to A55 was breeze with Samsung smart switch app, I transferred 50gb+ data around 15 mins via usb c to c offline - it retained all settings too! For Whatsapp - I had to manually transfer (You can copy whatsapp folder from old phone to new phone and when you go to activate whatsapp it will ask you to restore that data. Only lost 1 day of data, otherwise everything transferred successfully).About One UI - Probably best software experience with tons of features and customization options! Got Android 15 based One UI 7 just on 21st May a few days back. Samsung is late with Android update this year because Google released Android 16 developer builds quite early last year so Samsung had to work simultaneously on both 15 & 16. They have proven track record of timely updates and I think they will get it right soon. Only major android update came late but security patches have been timely. 4 OS and upto 5 years of security updates makes this phone future proof, you will be good till 2029!6) Battery - It's too good! Check screenshot I get 10+ hours sot. It's easy 2+ days backup for me on normal apps usage. As I just updated to One UI 7 it's in learning mode, I am expecting improvement. I will update the review. For charging I use my old 15w Samsung charger which charges 15-100% in 1:30 hrs. 25w charger should do full charge in 1 hour.7) Performance - Exynos 1480 is no slouch, it performs admirably without any major hiccups. I had some occassional slutters in One ui 6.1 but after one UI 7 it has improved - the overall experience is smoother, more responsive. This is not performance oriented phone so if you multitask a lot, play heavy games then look for other phones. For normal user this is more than enough. No heating at all - it hardly gets warm!8) Camera - I haven't used camera enough to share any judgement but initial impressions are quite positive. Check Youtube videos for better idea - I did and I liked what all of the cameras offer. Nothing to complain.9) Price & value - It was launched at ₹40K last year in March 24, I bought for ₹23700 in recent summer sale. It's always best to avoid buying at launch and wait for price drop next year.Overall A55 is a balanced phone that doesn't lack in any aspect & it's possibly the best VFM phone from Samsung right now!--Suggestions to get best performance & battery backup:1) Use LTE only network mode instead of 5g or automatic.2) Disable wifi, bluetooth, location scanning features and use them only when needed.3) Remove unnecessary apps and disable features you don't use.4) Settings - Google - All Service - disable data sharing features like usage & diagnostics etc.5) Disable Google contact sync. Manually synch it when needed so it won't drain battery in background.This should be enough to improve battery for most users.For advance users - you can get 20-30% more improvement in battery and noticeable performance increment by debloating. Check xdaforums for safe to remove and safe to disable One UI apps & services list."", ""I chose the Galaxy A55 bcz I got it at\xa0 ₹25,500 and it offered a great balance of build quality, software, and performance at a fair price. It felt more premium and reliable compared to others in the same range.Performance & DisplayPerformance is smooth , and it only heats slightly during charging and gaming simultaneously—nothing serious.

With Launching of A56 price had dropped by over 10K. It is still worth, recently got One UI 7 and Android 15 upgrade. Camera and battery quality are both good.I ordered with exchange however the delivery person deliberately found scratches on screen and phone. I don't understand Amazon exchange policy. If they are expecting box pack mobile then why not pay full price of old model rather than 500 or 1000 rupees. This was my 3rd experience where Amazon rejected exchange. Amazon seriously need to set clear guidelines for exchange and be transparent in their policy.

No lags or heating issues.✅ Display: The AMOLED 120Hz display is vibrant, fluid, and a treat to watch videos on.✅ Battery: 5500 mAh battery lasts easily more than a day, and the 100W SUPERVOOC charging is insanely fast – 0 to 100% in about 30 minutes!✅ Camera: Both rear and front cameras deliver sharp, detailed images in daylight. Low-light shots are decent too for this price range.✅ Design: Sleek, lightweight, and premium feel in hand. The Aqua Touch finish looks beautiful.✅ OxygenOS: Clean UI, minimal bloatware, and fast updates.Cons: ❌ No expandable storage – though 128/256 GB is usually enough.❌ Plastic frame – doesn’t feel cheap but could’ve been metal at this price point.', ""Worthy for brand but it is oppo UI I didn't like it and but built quality is awesome design is super remaining all are average but main discomfort screen time is not fix. It is automatically goto 15sec when we increase also it will stay only 24hrs after that back to 15secs. Brightness also good"", ""Here's my review after 2 weeks of usage-Pros-1. Great look & feel and good build quality.2. Fantastic display- very big with minimal bezels and great colors and sharpness. Brightness in direct sunlight is pretty good.3. Great cameras- Very natural colors and skin tones, with plenty of detail. Good color consistency between the two lenses. Ultrawide is obviously less sharp, but gets the job done. Portrait mode is the champion feature here. DSLR like shots, especially in the 2x mode. Low light photos are quite good and sharp too, but with less accurate white balance. Selfie camera also is amazing with high level of detail and good skin tones. Video clarity is also amazing, with surprisingly good zoom details.4. Excellent Audio- sound quality from the dual speakers is amazing with surprising amount of bass, clarity and stereo separation. Also mic recording quality is excellent, records in stereo as it has dual mics.5. Good Call quality - absolutely no problems. Its great.6. Network - Was getting network pretty much everywhere I travelled and good thing is that internet speed was pretty good even in traffic situations.7. Fantastic Battery life and charging-  After proper full charge, Lasts almost two dayson normal usage. Stand by is amazing, lost only 2-3% whole night. On heavy usage, easily can reach the next day with 2-3 hours worth of charge left.It is a charging beast, completes charging from 0 to 100 in 30-35 minutes, great for busy days. But make sure to keep the charging on until you receive a battery charge completed notification, otherwise you will experience slightly faster battery discharge.8. Fantastic Performance- Handles daily tasks like its nothing. I am not a gamer, but usually I tend to open and use multiple apps at once, like teams, uber, ola, maps and youtube music, and the phone doesn't break a sweat, handles it like a champ. Apps also open really fast. Observed little to no bugs or lags.9. Nice extras-Great premium haptic feedback nicely integrated with the UI.IR blaster is a nice addition.Bumper case included in the box is pretty nice with raised corners to protect the display, but can get dirty and attract stains pretty easily.3 months of additional warranty.Fast delivery by amazon.Cons-1. Video stabilization is not that great, can be improved.2. Zoom shots have too much contrast and appear a little too artificial, you actually see better details in view finder before taking the photo.3. Slow photo processing. If you take a moving shot or a burst shot, it will skip processing to freeze the action and will not have the same quality as a fully processed image.4. No official display protection. Some websites specify it is a panda glass, but still better to have a tempered screen guard.5. No headphone jack, which is a bummer. Should have in this price range.6. Missing app-opening animations, making the UI feel basic.7. Only 2 years of OS updates. It should be minimum 3 in this price range.8. No official IP rating, although it can handle small splashes of water drops and dust. At this price, it should be at least official.Conclusion-If you want a reliable all-rounder, you can easily go for Nord CE 4. I am fully satisfied with my purchase. Lovin' it."", 'Great phone under this price range, battery back up is also good.

With upgrades like the latest Snapdragon chipset, a revamped cooling system, and a display that’s buttery smooth, this phone is engineered for power users and mobile gamers. After weeks of testing, here’s our take.---### **Key Features Breakdown**1. **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 + LPDDR5X RAM & UFS 4.0 Storage**:The iQOO 13 is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. This combo delivers blistering speeds for multitasking, app launches, and gaming. *Genshin Impact* and *Honkai: Star Rail* run at near-max settings with zero stutters, even during marathon sessions.2. **6.78-inch AMOLED Display (144Hz Refresh Rate)**:The 1.5K AMOLED screen is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery 144Hz refresh rate. HDR10+ support and 3,000 nits peak brightness make outdoor visibility stellar. Gamers will love the 2,000Hz instant touch sampling rate for ultra-responsive controls.3. **Dual Cryo-Vapor Cooling System**:iQOO’s upgraded cooling tech keeps thermals in check during intense gaming. Even after an hour of *PUBG Mobile*, the phone stays comfortably warm—not scalding—with no performance throttling.4. **120W Fast Charging + 5,500mAh Battery**:The 5,500mAh battery lasts a full day of heavy use (6-7 hours screen-on time). When drained, the 120W charger juices it up to 50% in **10 minutes** and 100% in **25 minutes**. Wireless charging is notably absent, though.5. **Triple Camera Setup (50MP + 50MP + 64MP)**:The main 50MP Sony IMX966 sensor captures crisp, dynamic shots in daylight. The 64MP 3x periscope telephoto lens is a standout for sharp zoom (up to 10x hybrid), while low-light performance is decent but not class-leading. The 50MP ultra-wide avoids distortion at the edges.6. **Funtouch OS 14 (Android 14)**:iQOO’s skin is cleaner than before but still includes bloatware. Gaming features like *Monster Mode* (unlocks full CPU/GPU power) and *4D Game Vibration* (haptic feedback synced to in-game actions) add immersion.---### **Performance & Experience**- **Gaming**: This is where the iQOO 13 shines. The combo of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 144Hz display, and touch sampling makes it a mobile gaming beast. Paired with accessories like the iQOO Cooler, it’s a legitimate portable console.- **Daily Use**: Apps fly open, and the UI feels snappy. The flat-edge design offers a premium grip, though the glossy back attracts fingerprints (opt for the vegan leather variant).- **Audio**: Stereo speakers are loud and clear, but audiophiles will miss a headphone jack.---### **Pros vs. Cons****Pros**:✅ Unmatched gaming performance with sustained thermal management.✅ Gorgeous 144Hz AMOLED display with best-in-class touch response.✅ Blazing 120W charging and solid battery life.✅ Versatile camera setup for a performance-focused phone.**Cons**:❌ No wireless charging or IP68 rating (expected at this price).❌ Funtouch OS still feels cluttered compared to stock Android.❌ Bulky at 209g—not ideal for one-handed use.---### **Final Verdict**The iQOO 13 isn’t just a phone; it’s a statement for gamers and power users who refuse to compromise. While it lacks polish in areas like software and premium durability features, its performance, display, and charging speed make it a top contender in the flagship arena.**Who should buy it?**- Mobile gamers craving desktop-level performance.- Users who prioritize charging speed and screen smoothness.- Photography enthusiasts who want a competent camera *and* a powerhouse chipset.**Rating**: 4.3/5 — A near-perfect performance machine held back by minor omissions.*Bottom Line*: If raw power and gaming dominance top your checklist, the iQOO 13 is a thrill ride worth the ticket. For everyone else, wait for a sale or consider more balanced flagships. 🎮⚡', ""Truly amazing smartphone...First I would like to say I'm reviewing after 2 and half month usageFirst I was sceptical about the QC quality issues ..like panel gap and all...but I was gratefully that mine was perfectly fine with no issues...First impressions was very good but not about camera,but beleive me after the second update I did somewhat on April the camera was very outstanding ..the clarity was noticeably improvedThe main thing I buyed this was the performance and it didn't disappointed...The display,battery , performance,camera ,speakers,the call quality ,the charging speed.And the unique feature called monster RGB halo light that makes a attention magnet..and the overall looksEverything is simply amazing ,including additional featuresAnd the con I would like to say is ....1)slightly heating but comes back to normal at the same speed ..it's ok somewhat2) The OS minor bugs that I faced sometime,like stutters when scrolling in YouTube but only for sometime....""]","Camera, Performance & Display",0.3196464646464646,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jAxBrJCtL._SX679_.jpg

Seems like value for money.I am using the White version and it looks really good, the protective cover was black and is really well built and gives a good grip.I don't play games but it worked just fine when I tried few graphics intensive games.I got free OnePlus Buds 3 with this and they are really good, sound quality is quite good and yes the bass sounds nice. Their price at the time was ₹4,610"", ""Writing this review after using this device 1.5 months, absolute monster in performance, fluidity and battery. Though some say battery is draining after updates, I didn't notice anything like that. Snapdragon 8 gen 3is very powerful, and games are cake for this processor.Pros:1. Impressive performance2. Display to body ratio very high, gives a very premium look with the flat display3. Snapdragon 8 gen 3 is OP, with adaptive frame booster, game runs at constant 120fps even with HDR settings.4. Battery easily last 2 days even with heavy usage, if used less it lasts 3 days.5. Camera is good, don't know why oneplus was known for bad camera, yeah it slightly over processed the photos, but it's still pleasing to eyes, if you don't want that you can turn on natural mode, and reduces the saturation to make it look natural.6. 120hz display of this feels a lot smoother than other phones with 120hz like samsung s24, iphone 14 pro etc. oneplus 13 is even more smoother than this phone.7. Display is awesome, colors, hdr, pwm dimming ... Just perfect8. Oxygen OS 15(color OS15) is super optimized, the phones flies with regular usage, thanks to new parallel processing technology. AI features are also very good.9. Zero heating issues, even gaming cannot do anything more than just warming up the phone.Cons:1. Charging speed could have been better, the last 11r and 12r charges faster with 100w charger, but this one supports only 80w, take 1 hr to fully charge2. Telephoto lens has different color calibration compared to main lens, though it's not reflected while recording videos.3. Ultra wide lens is almost useless, captures very less details due to low mega pixels count.4. Could have some difference compared to color OS or realme UI.5. Metal frames gets hot while charging, which is good as it dissipates heat better than plastic.6. Oneplus has set the phone to limit performance when phone crosses 42° C, hence you don't get better scores in antutu, however if you do something to keep the phone below 38° C it gives impressive scores on antutu, when I tested, I got a 19.5 million score with high performance mode and phone touching 41 °C, however some youtubers show the phone scoring 21.5 million which is possible if phone has something to remove its heat.Overall, you can't find better refined phone in the whole 30k to 50k range. Just go for this phone.You don't have to worry about green line issues cause oneplus this time started using BOE X2 premium display which has better quality than samsung display which was the reason for green line issues. Also oneplus is the only brand to give life time warranty for green line issues.JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE"", ""No phone can be rated 5 out of 5. At the best 4.5 would be possible with something or the other falling short in a practical sense.Oneplus 13R has many great things under it's hood but half heartedly done to retain the difference between R and the non R phone.A. Positives.1. Display.Excellent and flat display. No concerns as it now comes with life time warranty for green line issues, if any and if at all which is a great peace of mind considering Oneplus would honour it. Supports Dolby vision, HDR +. The display is bright, clear and crisp. The under display optical finger print sensor is placed lower closer to the bottom bezel failing to the ergonomic placement. It could have been an inch above. However, no issues with it's operations. Quite quick but not as fast and quick as ultra sonic sensor.2. Processor.Excellent. No lags and no hiccups. (I am not into gaming but i know this would fare well based on my experience with S24 Ultra. Note that there would be heating felt upon prolonged heavy app use. However, this SoC would serve well for several years with new android updates. Now with Oneplus offering 4 plus 6 years SW update policy this is future proof hardware.3. Sound.Ok, the stereo sound is decent and loud enough but there's evident distortion over 90 percent volume setting. Bass isn't very evident. Also Dolby Atmos is now not available. Otherwise it's a proper stereo sounding speakers.4. RAM, Storage and Communication.Excellent specs with DDR5 and UFS 4.0. With base version starting at 12GB/256GB it's more than enough for most users. It is however let down with USB 2.0 post that limits transfer speeds but then it's something that wouldn't bother to most people who wouldn't be transferring data to and fro from other devices. IP protection is IP65 which is fine but IP 68 is a common thing at these prices especially from chinese phone makers. Haptics are tight but weak. A little more stronger motor would have been perfect.5. Battery.Excellent. Anything between 7 to 10 hours of SOT can easily be had from this phone. A proper full day battery unless you are into gaming all the day. I use 50 percent for my use case which involves social media, few camera photos and browsing with about 4 hours of SOT. Calling drains faster than multimedia watching which probably needs to be rectified with future updates. Some carrier bands seems to have been removed, however I didn't have any issues with calling or internet on my 4G airtel SIM. There's no wireless charging though.6. Call qualityVery good and clear. No issues at either end..signal reception is also good.B. Negatives.1. SoftwareThis is Color OS 15 which is slightly modified as Oxygen OS 15. It's super smooth and slick with lots of customizations possible. But still it's no where near Samsung One UI which is far superior, functional and feature rich than Oxygen OS 15. Also Oneplus added few bloatwares like Phone manager, Phone pick and few other apps. Luckily, you can either uninstall them or disable them.Interestingly, as an example the biggest overlooked setting is you can chose when to enter Power saving mode but you can come out of it only when you charge it till 90 percent. This is something that's silly and Oneplus must automatically disable power saving mode once the battery crosses it's trigger point. There are couple of such thoughtless things in Oxygen OS 15 which should be rectified. There's also nothing like Routines which Samsung offers on their S and A series for phone automation tasks.2. CamerasSome changes are positive but half hearted. Something like adding a telephoto 2X instead of macro which is such a welcome move, but then this lens has no OIS. UW 8 MP is just passable in daylight. In day light both main and 2X give good quality photos however low light performance is much to be desired. 3X with OIS would be more practical as such. Video on this phone is even more compromised with 4K limited to main sensor. All other sensors are capped at 1080P. In the front 16 MP camera is again okish for photos and handicapped for videos capped at 1080, 30 FPS which is a bummer. Overall Oneplus could have done better with the cameras but it seems like they intentionally subdued R series more to differentiate it with the pricier Oneplus 13 rather than on pricing front.3. AIThere are few AI features in photos, notes etc..but frankly they don't work as seamlessly or effectively as what can be seen on my S24U from Samsung. Oneplus has a long way to go in this aspect. Right now it's more gimmicky.My last Oneplus phone was 3T post which I switched to Samsung S series. No doubt S series,  especially Ultra is leagues ahead both hardware and software but when it comes to value for money Oneplus 13 series does shine. Moreso with their introductory pricing and offers. Yes some of the above shortcomings could have been included at this price point, but stills it's a safe bet and a promising phone for years of use with the kind of hardware and SW you get from Oneplus.I would recommend the Oneplus 13R phone under 40K for its hardware and revised SW update policy. Yes, Cameras could have been better though."", 'My first one plus phone and it is wonderful. Super fast to use and smooth UI.

And after using it for more than a month, here's my review.Pros1) exceptional camera quality. The 12MP ultra-wide does it's job and I would say going for 5x optical zoom with 50MP sensor instead for 10x 10MP sensor is a better choice as upto 30x I would say the pictures are more crisp than S23 ultra.2) Build quality is premium. It feels like a high budget smartphone. Not sure if titanium armor is enough to withstand high drop possibilities, but it does make it lighter.3) Screen is a big improvement. The anti reflective Corning Gorilla glass armor does it's job and reflects most of the glare so you can sit easily and watch without worrying if the person sitting next to you is watching coz they can't. 😁3) S-pen has improved a bit. A lot of people are saying that they don't use it much after first time, but that's not the case with me. If you will get the hang of it, you will use it quite often.4) AI interface is quite excellent. Although in initial phase, it does it's job in notes and summarising big pages so that you can easily get the gist.5) 7 years OS and security update is a big big up from my side.6) The box like built rather than a curve display is a better choice. It's easier to find a screen protector.7) sanpdragan 8 gen3 is fast. You can play high end games at maximum capacity. Android 14 with one UI 6 is smooth as you can hope it would be. I haven't recorded any lags or heating issues as for now.Cons1) Anti refective display works until you put  the above mention screen protector. After that it won't work with that precision. Although it still does it's job.2) Selfie camera is still not that great if you're using iPhone 14 or 15 pro.3) generative AI is not that great in calls and photo editing. Also, to pay for these services after 2025 is a big drawback from Samsung.4) Samsung is still not implementing faster charging protocols on their high and mid range smartphones. In a time when OnePlus is offering 100W charging speeds and xiomi offering 50-80W wireless charging, Samsung is still stuck with 45W and 15W wireless charging. Big drawback. However, battery do last for a full day.5) speaking of charging, no charger included is a serious letdown when you're spending more than a lac on a high end smartphone. Samsung, it doesn't feels good. 😔Overall, a good smartphone if you're thinking to go for a big one for a long time."", 'Genuine product : From the sellerS24 ultra is a great upgrade with most featuresGreat built qualityGood looksAwesome screenBetter connectivity  and receptionHandles all the tasks very well  with snapdragon 8 Gen 3ui 7  works like charmCamera  is a good Upgrade from SamsungAi works very well .Definitely I recommend this phablet to any body who is interested in a flag ship .With UI7  mostly heating issues r fixed .

I am coming from A52s phone - I have used flagship phones too but I realized they are overkill for my usage so I stopped buying expensive phones. Here are my thoughts on A55:1) Display - Less vibrant than previous A series phones as far as colors are concerned. This display produces more natural colors & I think this is good. No outdoor visibility issues. Bezels are a bit thicker but the quality of display compensates for that. Give it some time you will forget bezels.2) Sound - Nothing to complain, they do their job quite well - both top and bottom speakers sound equal quality & volume wise.3) Network & connectivity - Call quality very good, I was a bit concerned it might have problems with network strength as many people complain of Exynos based phones, fortunately this doesn't have any issues at least where I live and go  - note that I use LTE only mode and not 5G. I would get better idea when I will encounter low network areas. Wifi is also solid, Samsung gave dual band antennas unlike A52s which had single band - due to which speed was limited to 50mbps on wifi - glad the A55 gives full wifi speeds! Bluetooth works well as expected. When I connect my amplifier through bluetooth the phone automatically choose Aptx codec. LDAC codec is also supported if you have LDAC device. A52s was limited to AAC.4) Build and in-hand feel - We are getting such premium quality hardware in lower priced phones is big thumbs up. The phone is little heavy but you will get used to it. The back glass is slippery to hold in hand - you will definitely need case or at least a skin for better grip.5) Software - Transfering data from A52s to A55 was breeze with Samsung smart switch app, I transferred 50gb+ data around 15 mins via usb c to c offline - it retained all settings too! For Whatsapp - I had to manually transfer (You can copy whatsapp folder from old phone to new phone and when you go to activate whatsapp it will ask you to restore that data. Only lost 1 day of data, otherwise everything transferred successfully).About One UI - Probably best software experience with tons of features and customization options! Got Android 15 based One UI 7 just on 21st May a few days back. Samsung is late with Android update this year because Google released Android 16 developer builds quite early last year so Samsung had to work simultaneously on both 15 & 16. They have proven track record of timely updates and I think they will get it right soon. Only major android update came late but security patches have been timely. 4 OS and upto 5 years of security updates makes this phone future proof, you will be good till 2029!6) Battery - It's too good! Check screenshot I get 10+ hours sot. It's easy 2+ days backup for me on normal apps usage. As I just updated to One UI 7 it's in learning mode, I am expecting improvement. I will update the review. For charging I use my old 15w Samsung charger which charges 15-100% in 1:30 hrs. 25w charger should do full charge in 1 hour.7) Performance - Exynos 1480 is no slouch, it performs admirably without any major hiccups. I had some occassional slutters in One ui 6.1 but after one UI 7 it has improved - the overall experience is smoother, more responsive. This is not performance oriented phone so if you multitask a lot, play heavy games then look for other phones. For normal user this is more than enough. No heating at all - it hardly gets warm!8) Camera - I haven't used camera enough to share any judgement but initial impressions are quite positive. Check Youtube videos for better idea - I did and I liked what all of the cameras offer. Nothing to complain.9) Price & value - It was launched at ₹40K last year in March 24, I bought for ₹23700 in recent summer sale. It's always best to avoid buying at launch and wait for price drop next year.Overall A55 is a balanced phone that doesn't lack in any aspect & it's possibly the best VFM phone from Samsung right now!--Suggestions to get best performance & battery backup:1) Use LTE only network mode instead of 5g or automatic.2) Disable wifi, bluetooth, location scanning features and use them only when needed.3) Remove unnecessary apps and disable features you don't use.4) Settings - Google - All Service - disable data sharing features like usage & diagnostics etc.5) Disable Google contact sync. Manually synch it when needed so it won't drain battery in background.This should be enough to improve battery for most users.For advance users - you can get 20-30% more improvement in battery and noticeable performance increment by debloating. Check xdaforums for safe to remove and safe to disable One UI apps & services list."", ""I chose the Galaxy A55 bcz I got it at\xa0 ₹25,500 and it offered a great balance of build quality, software, and performance at a fair price. It felt more premium and reliable compared to others in the same range.Performance & DisplayPerformance is smooth , and it only heats slightly during charging and gaming simultaneously—nothing serious. The display is vibrant and sharp, great for media and outdoor use.Battery & ChargingBattery life is decent for a day’s use, but 25W charging is slower than many competitors. It is the only problemCameraThe camera is fine for casual use, but don’t expect flagship-level shots.Build & ValueThe phone feels premium and sturdy in hand, though a little bit on the heavier side. Overall, at this price, it's definitely good value for money.Charging speed:SlowBattery life:OkFeatures:GoodFeel:GreatPerformance:Ok to good (for Exynos)Heating issue:Only when you charge and game at same time"", ""Samsung A55 mobile is good. With Launching of A56 price had dropped by over 10K. It is still worth, recently got One UI 7 and Android 15 upgrade. Camera and battery quality are both good.I ordered with exchange however the delivery person deliberately found scratches on screen and phone. I don't understand Amazon exchange policy. If they are expecting box pack mobile then why not pay full price of old model rather than 500 or 1000 rupees. This was my 3rd experience where Amazon rejected exchange. Amazon seriously need to set clear guidelines for exchange and be transparent in their policy. My opinion is not to purchase with Amazon exchange rather give mobile your helper someone needy."", ""Great phone under 30k..I bought the 256gb variant at 29k in Summer sale.. it's an almost perfect phone..Camera: 9/10 [Very Good Camera Setup and it doesn't struggle in most of the cases, selfie cam is not good at all..

I personally play a lot of gatcha games like Genshin, Honkai and Wuthering Waves, over fps shooting so I would definitely say that gatcha games being heavier in graphics, Nord 4 is capable to provide the most efficient gaming. Practically speaking if you avoid those YouTube reviews with AnTuTu, any android phone would at some point face fps drop if you play in the highest settings and I do believe with what I've heard that even with high end processors like Snapdragon 7+ 3, OnePlus always limits it's potential which is why we do get to see some throttling, but on a long term it doesn't matter. If you are a daily user with 2-3 hours of heavy gaming per day or more with breaks after every 45 minutes to 1 hour of heavy graphic gameplay, then you could definitely have a great experience. If you are just a normal user, you can choose it blindly.3) Built and UI: (9/10 for strength and quality but 7/10 for being expensive to replace)Ofcourse being metal you would expect a little bit of weight (around 200 grams) but you get used to it and it really feels much premium to feel that metallic weight in your hand. It might get really slippery and if it falls down it might not have scratches except for the glass portion around the camera but might face dents on the metal if the fall is too harsh, so I would suggest to have a back cover, and let's be honest no matter how premium the phone is even if it looks great, they are all at the end of the day sensitive and how you manage to care for it depends totally on you. Be responsible. And as I mentioned, it's going to be really expensive to replace a unibody metal frame if it's cracked or dented even if it's strong enough to work so be careful.As for the UI I've been a Xiaomi user so honestly I don't feel much different in terms of operating system with bloatware, but I really don't feel bothered by it as long as I'm able to disable it. I uninstalled and disabled not almost but EVERY single bloatware in this phone that I possibly could have including app market and even the gaming tool so now I don't get those security checks after installing apps and it feels as clean as any Flagship phone.3) Battery: (8/10)It's good. Definitely better battery life than my iPhone BUT for how big the battery is, the Oxygen OS hasn't optimised it's battery life to it's maximum just as I mentioned before for its Processor but it's not a big deal.5500mAH is something we see less as the price goes higher over handheld devices because they try to add more space for gimmicks like wireless charging which in my opinion is not very practical everytime unless you carry a wireless charger everywhere and they are really slow. But the wired charging in OnePlus with the 100 watt out of the box charger is great and it charges the device to full within 30 minutes tho I would suggest to toggle the option from Battery Health settings to charge it till 80 percentage so you can keep it's battery health stable for long. I hope they optimise it in the future updates but honestly it gives you around 7-8 hours of life with regular usage and even more if you are a light user which is more than enough considering that at some point you will need to charge your device any way.4) Display: (8/10)It's a very smooth 120hz amoled panel with HDR support in Netflix that I never really use because I watch on my MacBook or the television (it's just better to watch anything on a bigger display over a phone to keep your visions safe) and an unnamed protection (Panda glass according to few sources) but I'll be practical over how much it actually matters. Being someone who has changed the displays in the past after getting it broken, it doesn't matter what Gorilla glass they put on your phone, it's a glass at the end of the day and if you are not being responsible enough by handling your phone with care, it's expected for your screen to face damage. Use a good tempered glass around 3-4 USD (200-400 INR) I won't suggest to go higher because no matter how expensive it is, even if it's able to handle a bend test, practically any tempered display is penetrable if it falls flat on a rough surface UNLESS you have a good thick back cover. Overall it's a good display but I feel that the brightness could be a bit bother outside if you live in a heavily bright environment. Personally I didn't face any issues for the time being as the peak brightness is really good in the sunlight but if you compare it to some cheaper devices, it might feel a little less.5) Heating Stabilization: (9/10)I mean, it's metal? Ofcourse it's going to be hot DURING a gameplay but HEATING DOESN'T MEAN PERFORMANCE DROP. Also it's during the time when you are playing or doing some heavy task but the best part of metal is that it cools down as fast as it heats up and the cooling chamber in this phone is really efficient. Overall It's definitely better in terms of heat stabilization than any glass/plastic built phones for being a metal although I would say that, if you are travelling in a constantly hot temperature, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight for too long as it might get hot or else again, Use a back cover. BUT I'd also suggest to not use a back cover when doing some heavy gaming because it makes you loose the purpose of having a metal phone with such a good heating stabilization as plastic makes it harder to escape the heat.6) Camera: (7/10 Subjective)This isn't my place but I would still give some opinion. It is decent and when I say that, it is actually not bad at all infact really good along it's limitations. It has a very natural tone on the back camera with a really good potrait mode and a decent front camera definitely better than a 25k phone but ofcourse with the specifications you see, there are limitations if you compare it to other phones in the same price. It's definitely better than Nothing 2a in terms of color and stability but not as close to camera centred phones like Vivo/Realme in the midrange but then again those phones lack either performance or the brand value, as OnePlus is much premium as a brand than Vivo/Realme even if they are from the same company. Again it is subjective and this phone in my opinion is rather a balance of performance along with the things you need in a midrange close-to-flagship phone rather than being an entire camera phone, but it's still really good even with the limitations of telephoto and other things that I find gimmick because I'm not a camera phone user.Overall: (8.25)It's a great phone for both everyday users and decent to heavy gamers. I might score it higher in the future if they successfully optimise the Operating system in the future updates and push it to 9 even with a decent camera because this phone has a lot of potential and considering it's future update promises of 4+6 for Android and security patch, it's a very good purchase. Just praying that these phones don't face any green line issues in the future."", '✅ Positive Review Points:1. Design & Build Quality:OnePlus Nord 4 design chala premium ga undi.

I am coming from A52s phone - I have used flagship phones too but I realized they are overkill for my usage so I stopped buying expensive phones. Here are my thoughts on A55:1) Display - Less vibrant than previous A series phones as far as colors are concerned. This display produces more natural colors & I think this is good. No outdoor visibility issues. Bezels are a bit thicker but the quality of display compensates for that. Give it some time you will forget bezels.2) Sound - Nothing to complain, they do their job quite well - both top and bottom speakers sound equal quality & volume wise.3) Network & connectivity - Call quality very good, I was a bit concerned it might have problems with network strength as many people complain of Exynos based phones, fortunately this doesn't have any issues at least where I live and go  - note that I use LTE only mode and not 5G. I would get better idea when I will encounter low network areas. Wifi is also solid, Samsung gave dual band antennas unlike A52s which had single band - due to which speed was limited to 50mbps on wifi - glad the A55 gives full wifi speeds! Bluetooth works well as expected. When I connect my amplifier through bluetooth the phone automatically choose Aptx codec. LDAC codec is also supported if you have LDAC device. A52s was limited to AAC.4) Build and in-hand feel - We are getting such premium quality hardware in lower priced phones is big thumbs up. The phone is little heavy but you will get used to it. The back glass is slippery to hold in hand - you will definitely need case or at least a skin for better grip.5) Software - Transfering data from A52s to A55 was breeze with Samsung smart switch app, I transferred 50gb+ data around 15 mins via usb c to c offline - it retained all settings too! For Whatsapp - I had to manually transfer (You can copy whatsapp folder from old phone to new phone and when you go to activate whatsapp it will ask you to restore that data. Only lost 1 day of data, otherwise everything transferred successfully).About One UI - Probably best software experience with tons of features and customization options! Got Android 15 based One UI 7 just on 21st May a few days back. Samsung is late with Android update this year because Google released Android 16 developer builds quite early last year so Samsung had to work simultaneously on both 15 & 16. They have proven track record of timely updates and I think they will get it right soon. Only major android update came late but security patches have been timely. 4 OS and upto 5 years of security updates makes this phone future proof, you will be good till 2029!6) Battery - It's too good! Check screenshot I get 10+ hours sot. It's easy 2+ days backup for me on normal apps usage. As I just updated to One UI 7 it's in learning mode, I am expecting improvement. I will update the review. For charging I use my old 15w Samsung charger which charges 15-100% in 1:30 hrs. 25w charger should do full charge in 1 hour.7) Performance - Exynos 1480 is no slouch, it performs admirably without any major hiccups. I had some occassional slutters in One ui 6.1 but after one UI 7 it has improved - the overall experience is smoother, more responsive. This is not performance oriented phone so if you multitask a lot, play heavy games then look for other phones. For normal user this is more than enough. No heating at all - it hardly gets warm!8) Camera - I haven't used camera enough to share any judgement but initial impressions are quite positive. Check Youtube videos for better idea - I did and I liked what all of the cameras offer. Nothing to complain.9) Price & value - It was launched at ₹40K last year in March 24, I bought for ₹23700 in recent summer sale. It's always best to avoid buying at launch and wait for price drop next year.Overall A55 is a balanced phone that doesn't lack in any aspect & it's possibly the best VFM phone from Samsung right now!--Suggestions to get best performance & battery backup:1) Use LTE only network mode instead of 5g or automatic.2) Disable wifi, bluetooth, location scanning features and use them only when needed.3) Remove unnecessary apps and disable features you don't use.4) Settings - Google - All Service - disable data sharing features like usage & diagnostics etc.5) Disable Google contact sync. Manually synch it when needed so it won't drain battery in background.This should be enough to improve battery for most users.For advance users - you can get 20-30% more improvement in battery and noticeable performance increment by debloating. Check xdaforums for safe to remove and safe to disable One UI apps & services list."", ""I chose the Galaxy A55 bcz I got it at\xa0 ₹25,500 and it offered a great balance of build quality, software, and performance at a fair price. It felt more premium and reliable compared to others in the same range.Performance & DisplayPerformance is smooth , and it only heats slightly during charging and gaming simultaneously—nothing serious.

With Launching of A56 price had dropped by over 10K. It is still worth, recently got One UI 7 and Android 15 upgrade. Camera and battery quality are both good.I ordered with exchange however the delivery person deliberately found scratches on screen and phone. I don't understand Amazon exchange policy. If they are expecting box pack mobile then why not pay full price of old model rather than 500 or 1000 rupees. This was my 3rd experience where Amazon rejected exchange. Amazon seriously need to set clear guidelines for exchange and be transparent in their policy. My opinion is not to purchase with Amazon exchange rather give mobile your helper someone needy."", ""Great phone under 30k..I bought the 256gb variant at 29k in Summer sale.. it's an almost perfect phone..Camera: 9/10 [Very Good Camera Setup and it doesn't struggle in most of the cases, selfie cam is not good at all..

I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.', ""Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed.

The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞"", ""I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience."", ""Everything is on point as expected.

Homescreen, lock screen effects cam be customized easily. Can even play upto 144 fps in certain games. Has monster mode(voice changer, background calls,split screen etc) but heats slightly when gaming on high environment temp. With 90-120 fps gaming, it heats significantly.

If you are a guy with optimum usage no games and all or you are a guy with heavy games and editing, it will be a butter smooth experience , not tried 144fps will update later .one thing is 2.4 million antutu score is experienced only on 16gb variant not on all devices mentioned in their website itself I felt to share with you all.BGMI : first of all there is no such fps shifting from 120 to 90 so pls don't believe on that rumour, second thing bgmi runs like butter on both 90 and 120 fps and no such noticable heatings even after 5 hrs or more gaming. Talking about battery, per tdm costs 1% battery, 1 hr of proper chicken dinner classic match will drain upto 10-15% battery, mine lasts 30-40 mins and it drain 9-10% which is good for me . There is no poor screen recordings so feel free to buy for bgmiBattery: it comes with 7000mah and with 120 w adapter, normal use lasts for 2 days with 12hr+ screen time and bgmi will run approx 8-9 hrs I have not tested it but played 5-6 hrs straight and it went upto 35 % u can expect more 2-3 hrs easily. Charging speed is really fast and exactly what iqoo claims so no worries about that .Camera : camera is good tbh not a camera centric but compared it with iqoo z9s , moto edge 50 fusion and vivo v40 too of my family members. Images are far better than z9s and edge 50 fusion but not so good as vivo v40 and u can expect that but video quality is on next level it's actually blew me its better than all other three . I will advise use 4k30fpsDisplay: colour full and bright. No problem in using it under direct Sunlight peak brightness is osm .IR blaster is really amazing works perfectly but only thing which lacking in this device is IP rating and titanium colour is actually amazing but I feel it's not giving that premium quality being a 36k phone could have been better. I will suggest those who are searching here for a premium phone with day today normal work , camera and display can go for vivo v40 or pro versionOverall this phone is totally value for money, so happy that I got a device which I really wanted to seen couple of stupid reviews and was changing my decision took a risk and it's worth it . One thing to mention is your fps will drop to 60 fps only when you are on battery saver mode before starting the game or at 75% once you change the fps setting again or disable the battery saver mode you are on 👍. I will surely share some clips and images if you find this review helpful"", 'Battery and charging speed is unmatchable, unbeatable and really really good. I have not seen this capacity of battery and this speed of charging.Camera is having pros also and cons also, like in low light this camera is performing better than apple.

The wide angle photos and vedios are very poor if you compare with Samsung and apple.Performance is decent because of the Snapdragon 8s Gen4 but also this phone has features to make you feel more faster user experience.

Yes there is a competitor of this phone also which is poco F7.I have uploaded some camera samples also.Himanshu Singh', ""For Gamers, it's a gem of a phone. But you have to keep touch sampling rate as 'Recommended'. If kept as 'High', the battery will drain faster. You will get 110-120 fps on average for BGMI. Camera is above expectation being a gaming phone. For someone who prefers zoomed photography, it's not that good since it doesn't have periscope camera. Otherwise, it takes really good photos. UI is good but could be better. Brightness is also good with features like eye-protection. Sound quantity is also nice and loud, though Dolby Atmos support is not provided.

From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use.

In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer."", 'Great experience to all performanceDisplay 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 5/5Best processor in segmentCamera awesome pictureThis is a good option for all one person found this helpful😎😎😊 Dame true experience to all use Mobile features', ""I'm blown away by how fast this phone is.

The performance is blazing fast — apps load instantly, multitasking is smooth, and gaming is lag-free thanks to the Snapdragon chipset. Screen size is 6.78 Amoled display so it give great experience watching online content. It has ample storage capacity so can store multiple pictures and videos.The display is crisp, vibrant, and perfect for streaming or gaming. Battery life easily lasts a full day, and the fast charging is a real time-saver. The Moonlight finish looks sleek and premium — definitely stands out.If I had to nitpick, I’d say the phone feels slightly on the heavier side, especially during prolonged use. But honestly, it’s a small trade-off for the build quality and features packed in.For the price, this is a powerful, stylish phone that punches well above its weight.

I was suspicious but the seal on the box was intact and seemed untouched. So I accepted it.The phone functions smoothly and the colors are crisp. It feels bulky though. Battery easily lasts for a day on a single charge. I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.', ""Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens."", ""Best if you get this in 13499 and go for Samsung original charger cost around 1000 it charge phone in very less time as compared to any normal charger and best cover is spign essential kit you'll get it for 599 something or only spign sand blast cover cost 700CONCLUSION:- I AM SURE YOU HAVE WATCHED REVIEW OF THIS PHONE DONT THINK MUCH PURCHASE IF GETTING FOR 13500 BECAUSE ACCESORIES WILL MAKE WHOLE FIGURE 15000 OR MORE SOMETIME HOPE IT HELP"", 'Cellulare molto bello .', 'Good Products', 'Very good seller and good quality device... i recommended this seller', 'Highly recommended', 'Es un Samsung, ya con eso poco queda ya por decir, lo compré para mi madre, elegí éste modelo porque podía ponerle el modo sencillo ,solo con lo más básico, y le va bien, pero Samsung debería pensar más en las personas con problemas de audición y tener un modo para ello, el volumen podría ser más alto, he tenido que descargarle una aplicación para ponerle los tonos de llamada más alto, por lo demás, llegó en perfectas condiciones, se ve la calidad y la batería dura mucho.']",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.3234285714285714,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nt-RGKpyL._SX679_.jpg

( Rating - 4.7 / 5.0 )This Device is not very tall or wide, perfectly in size for grip and hold. Very Lightweight (180 Grams) and slim to carry inside your pocket and you won't fell that you are carrying any bulky thing inside. That is the reason I must recommend this device for office or business persons. Now, I will try to elaborate all the details and specs about this device briefly and try to analyze all the positive and negative points about this device.Specs Details :-------------------1. ( Display Quality ) - 6.7 '' Display as I mentioned it earlier not too tall or too wide, perfect in size for gripping. Looks Premium when you watch any 4K HDR videos on You tube. Not fully Curved, everything is visible on extreme either under or upper surface of the screen. Gamers also can use this device and will not be disappointed. Variation of colors look pragmatic, feel worthy to watch from any angle.Rating - 5/52. (Battery Life ) - 6000 MAH Battery lasts for 1.5 day for moderate use, 2 Days for light use and 1 day for heavy use. This will vary user to user not specific for everyone.Heavy Usage - S.O.T (Screen on Time ) - 6+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 16+ Hrs.Moderate Usage - S.O.T - 8+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 24+ Hrs.Light Usage - S.O.T - 10+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 30+ Hrs.Rating - 5/53. (Charging Speed) - There are options, if enabled device will charge rapidly with the given 80w Charger ( 5 % - 95% within 45 mins ). Smart charging option is also available in which battery will stop charging after 80%.Rating - 4.7/54. ( Heating Issue ) - Not heated at all. If someone will write a review and tell others that the device will heated up during charging then he or she might not aware of the technology. If you will use 30W + adapter while charging any device in this whole universe will get heated naturally. Now, think about 120W adapter -_- . As I mentioned ( not heated at all ) means will not cross 40 degree in any circumstances. and 28 - 39 Degree is vary from summer to winter and the place where you are using it. if you are using it in extreme sunlight it will touch 38. That's not mean the device is internally heated.5. (CPU & RAM Management) - Maximum Clocked at 2.6 GHZ , Dual channel LPDDR4X RAM and UFS 3.1 provide you much batter experience within this budget. Some Device is providing LPDDR5 & UFS 2.2 within this segment but in reality storage speed matters a lot than the RAM. (Before buying you have to understand the difference among LPDDR4X, LPDDR5 & LPDDR5X). Video Rendering and Game Loading is excellent. Out of 10 apps, it will retain 8 apps in RAM after 10 mins. Which is quite well balanced within this budget. Antutu Score is above 750K.Rating - 4.8 / 56. ( Smoothness ) - Buttery Smooth and no mistouches as it comes with curved display.Rating - 5/57. ( Camera Quality ) - SONY IMX 882 50 MP clicks good photos in indoor and outdoor. 2x normal and 5x digitally  zoom options are available. Night photos are also  natural not over contrasty or brighter. Detailing in portrait mode is also great. Edge detection is up to the mark. Overall nice within this range. you can not accept very high camera quality under 20k.Rating - 4.8 / 5Overall, balanced phone in every aspect and comes with IP rating 66 68 & 69.

Their price at the time was ₹4,610"", ""Writing this review after using this device 1.5 months, absolute monster in performance, fluidity and battery. Though some say battery is draining after updates, I didn't notice anything like that. Snapdragon 8 gen 3is very powerful, and games are cake for this processor.Pros:1. Impressive performance2. Display to body ratio very high, gives a very premium look with the flat display3. Snapdragon 8 gen 3 is OP, with adaptive frame booster, game runs at constant 120fps even with HDR settings.4. Battery easily last 2 days even with heavy usage, if used less it lasts 3 days.5. Camera is good, don't know why oneplus was known for bad camera, yeah it slightly over processed the photos, but it's still pleasing to eyes, if you don't want that you can turn on natural mode, and reduces the saturation to make it look natural.6. 120hz display of this feels a lot smoother than other phones with 120hz like samsung s24, iphone 14 pro etc. oneplus 13 is even more smoother than this phone.7. Display is awesome, colors, hdr, pwm dimming ... Just perfect8. Oxygen OS 15(color OS15) is super optimized, the phones flies with regular usage, thanks to new parallel processing technology. AI features are also very good.9. Zero heating issues, even gaming cannot do anything more than just warming up the phone.Cons:1. Charging speed could have been better, the last 11r and 12r charges faster with 100w charger, but this one supports only 80w, take 1 hr to fully charge2. Telephoto lens has different color calibration compared to main lens, though it's not reflected while recording videos.3. Ultra wide lens is almost useless, captures very less details due to low mega pixels count.4. Could have some difference compared to color OS or realme UI.5. Metal frames gets hot while charging, which is good as it dissipates heat better than plastic.6. Oneplus has set the phone to limit performance when phone crosses 42° C, hence you don't get better scores in antutu, however if you do something to keep the phone below 38° C it gives impressive scores on antutu, when I tested, I got a 19.5 million score with high performance mode and phone touching 41 °C, however some youtubers show the phone scoring 21.5 million which is possible if phone has something to remove its heat.Overall, you can't find better refined phone in the whole 30k to 50k range. Just go for this phone.You don't have to worry about green line issues cause oneplus this time started using BOE X2 premium display which has better quality than samsung display which was the reason for green line issues. Also oneplus is the only brand to give life time warranty for green line issues.JUST GO FOR THIS PHONE"", ""No phone can be rated 5 out of 5. At the best 4.5 would be possible with something or the other falling short in a practical sense.Oneplus 13R has many great things under it's hood but half heartedly done to retain the difference between R and the non R phone.A. Positives.1. Display.Excellent and flat display. No concerns as it now comes with life time warranty for green line issues, if any and if at all which is a great peace of mind considering Oneplus would honour it. Supports Dolby vision, HDR +. The display is bright, clear and crisp. The under display optical finger print sensor is placed lower closer to the bottom bezel failing to the ergonomic placement. It could have been an inch above. However, no issues with it's operations. Quite quick but not as fast and quick as ultra sonic sensor.2. Processor.Excellent. No lags and no hiccups. (I am not into gaming but i know this would fare well based on my experience with S24 Ultra. Note that there would be heating felt upon prolonged heavy app use. However, this SoC would serve well for several years with new android updates. Now with Oneplus offering 4 plus 6 years SW update policy this is future proof hardware.3. Sound.Ok, the stereo sound is decent and loud enough but there's evident distortion over 90 percent volume setting. Bass isn't very evident. Also Dolby Atmos is now not available. Otherwise it's a proper stereo sounding speakers.4. RAM, Storage and Communication.Excellent specs with DDR5 and UFS 4.0. With base version starting at 12GB/256GB it's more than enough for most users. It is however let down with USB 2.0 post that limits transfer speeds but then it's something that wouldn't bother to most people who wouldn't be transferring data to and fro from other devices. IP protection is IP65 which is fine but IP 68 is a common thing at these prices especially from chinese phone makers. Haptics are tight but weak. A little more stronger motor would have been perfect.5. Battery.Excellent. Anything between 7 to 10 hours of SOT can easily be had from this phone. A proper full day battery unless you are into gaming all the day. I use 50 percent for my use case which involves social media, few camera photos and browsing with about 4 hours of SOT. Calling drains faster than multimedia watching which probably needs to be rectified with future updates. Some carrier bands seems to have been removed, however I didn't have any issues with calling or internet on my 4G airtel SIM. There's no wireless charging though.6. Call qualityVery good and clear. No issues at either end..signal reception is also good.B. Negatives.1. SoftwareThis is Color OS 15 which is slightly modified as Oxygen OS 15. It's super smooth and slick with lots of customizations possible. But still it's no where near Samsung One UI which is far superior, functional and feature rich than Oxygen OS 15. Also Oneplus added few bloatwares like Phone manager, Phone pick and few other apps. Luckily, you can either uninstall them or disable them.Interestingly, as an example the biggest overlooked setting is you can chose when to enter Power saving mode but you can come out of it only when you charge it till 90 percent. This is something that's silly and Oneplus must automatically disable power saving mode once the battery crosses it's trigger point. There are couple of such thoughtless things in Oxygen OS 15 which should be rectified. There's also nothing like Routines which Samsung offers on their S and A series for phone automation tasks.2. CamerasSome changes are positive but half hearted. Something like adding a telephoto 2X instead of macro which is such a welcome move, but then this lens has no OIS. UW 8 MP is just passable in daylight. In day light both main and 2X give good quality photos however low light performance is much to be desired. 3X with OIS would be more practical as such. Video on this phone is even more compromised with 4K limited to main sensor. All other sensors are capped at 1080P. In the front 16 MP camera is again okish for photos and handicapped for videos capped at 1080, 30 FPS which is a bummer. Overall Oneplus could have done better with the cameras but it seems like they intentionally subdued R series more to differentiate it with the pricier Oneplus 13 rather than on pricing front.3. AIThere are few AI features in photos, notes etc..but frankly they don't work as seamlessly or effectively as what can be seen on my S24U from Samsung. Oneplus has a long way to go in this aspect. Right now it's more gimmicky.My last Oneplus phone was 3T post which I switched to Samsung S series. No doubt S series,  especially Ultra is leagues ahead both hardware and software but when it comes to value for money Oneplus 13 series does shine. Moreso with their introductory pricing and offers. Yes some of the above shortcomings could have been included at this price point, but stills it's a safe bet and a promising phone for years of use with the kind of hardware and SW you get from Oneplus.I would recommend the Oneplus 13R phone under 40K for its hardware and revised SW update policy. Yes, Cameras could have been better though."", 'My first one plus phone and it is wonderful. Super fast to use and smooth UI.

There are more pros in device than cons and I must say no other phone can beat this in this particular price segment.Design and Build (9/10)-The phone feels quite sleek and comfortable in hand. Weighing just about 180g and about 7.5mm thick. This phone is by far the slimmest and lightest 5500Mah phone I have ever seen. Even slimmer and slighter than many 5000Mah phone is the market. Ther design language is taken from newly launched Vivo v40 series and this phone is exact replica or little toned down version of Vivo V40e. So you are getting a 28k V40e phone under 20k. A sweet deal right.Display(8.5/10) -- The display is a typical 120Hz, Oled panel with deep black and around 1000 nits of peak brightness which is more than enough in outdoor environment. Colours are punchy and crisp. You get different colour modes which you can set as per your taste.Camera (9/10)-  Camera is just outstanding. I have never seen such an amazing low light performance from any 15-20k phones in the recent times. The camera balances light very well and even in backlite situation the photos are amazing. The 2x potraits are awesome coupled with various background bokeh modes. Colours are good and dynamic range is fantastic. This phone is camera beast in 18k and I must say Well done Iqoo. They focused on giving 1 very good camera rather than two or three average cameras. Many brands give useless 8MP wide angle camera and mediocre primary camera in this range. If wide angle is your priority than you can go with Iqoo z9s pro model.Performance(9/10)--This phone can handle days to day task very smoothly with no zitter or lag. Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.Battery (10/10)--Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.Software and other features (7/10)--The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added."", 'First time I purchase iqoo z9s mobile to be honest I m very happy for everything in this mobile every feature is so cool and comfortable and also looks very beautiful and stunning, very slim and very much pretty...5g runs very well, camera quality is superb❤️❤️❤️💯perfact for everyone who want to purchase this mobile...Mera to best ever phone hai ye 🥰😍', 'Hello.

If you are a guy with optimum usage no games and all or you are a guy with heavy games and editing, it will be a butter smooth experience , not tried 144fps will update later .one thing is 2.4 million antutu score is experienced only on 16gb variant not on all devices mentioned in their website itself I felt to share with you all.BGMI : first of all there is no such fps shifting from 120 to 90 so pls don't believe on that rumour, second thing bgmi runs like butter on both 90 and 120 fps and no such noticable heatings even after 5 hrs or more gaming. Talking about battery, per tdm costs 1% battery, 1 hr of proper chicken dinner classic match will drain upto 10-15% battery, mine lasts 30-40 mins and it drain 9-10% which is good for me . There is no poor screen recordings so feel free to buy for bgmiBattery: it comes with 7000mah and with 120 w adapter, normal use lasts for 2 days with 12hr+ screen time and bgmi will run approx 8-9 hrs I have not tested it but played 5-6 hrs straight and it went upto 35 % u can expect more 2-3 hrs easily. Charging speed is really fast and exactly what iqoo claims so no worries about that .Camera : camera is good tbh not a camera centric but compared it with iqoo z9s , moto edge 50 fusion and vivo v40 too of my family members. Images are far better than z9s and edge 50 fusion but not so good as vivo v40 and u can expect that but video quality is on next level it's actually blew me its better than all other three . I will advise use 4k30fpsDisplay: colour full and bright. No problem in using it under direct Sunlight peak brightness is osm .IR blaster is really amazing works perfectly but only thing which lacking in this device is IP rating and titanium colour is actually amazing but I feel it's not giving that premium quality being a 36k phone could have been better. I will suggest those who are searching here for a premium phone with day today normal work , camera and display can go for vivo v40 or pro versionOverall this phone is totally value for money, so happy that I got a device which I really wanted to seen couple of stupid reviews and was changing my decision took a risk and it's worth it . One thing to mention is your fps will drop to 60 fps only when you are on battery saver mode before starting the game or at 75% once you change the fps setting again or disable the battery saver mode you are on 👍. I will surely share some clips and images if you find this review helpful"", 'Battery and charging speed is unmatchable, unbeatable and really really good. I have not seen this capacity of battery and this speed of charging.Camera is having pros also and cons also, like in low light this camera is performing better than apple. Then in potraits photo this camera is stunning and unbeatable. Yes because this a 50mp camera so you can not take heavy zooming photos like Samsung. The wide angle photos and vedios are very poor if you compare with Samsung and apple.Performance is decent because of the Snapdragon 8s Gen4 but also this phone has features to make you feel more faster user experience. I have not seen any phone installing the applications faster than this phone.Display is big and bright. But there is a missing premium feel of touch.

But you have to keep touch sampling rate as 'Recommended'. If kept as 'High', the battery will drain faster. You will get 110-120 fps on average for BGMI. Camera is above expectation being a gaming phone. For someone who prefers zoomed photography, it's not that good since it doesn't have periscope camera. Otherwise, it takes really good photos. UI is good but could be better. Brightness is also good with features like eye-protection. Sound quantity is also nice and loud, though Dolby Atmos support is not provided.

The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞"", ""I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience."", ""Everything is on point as expected.

No lags or heating issues.✅ Display: The AMOLED 120Hz display is vibrant, fluid, and a treat to watch videos on.✅ Battery: 5500 mAh battery lasts easily more than a day, and the 100W SUPERVOOC charging is insanely fast – 0 to 100% in about 30 minutes!✅ Camera: Both rear and front cameras deliver sharp, detailed images in daylight. Low-light shots are decent too for this price range.✅ Design: Sleek, lightweight, and premium feel in hand. The Aqua Touch finish looks beautiful.✅ OxygenOS: Clean UI, minimal bloatware, and fast updates.Cons: ❌ No expandable storage – though 128/256 GB is usually enough.❌ Plastic frame – doesn’t feel cheap but could’ve been metal at this price point.', ""Worthy for brand but it is oppo UI I didn't like it and but built quality is awesome design is super remaining all are average but main discomfort screen time is not fix. It is automatically goto 15sec when we increase also it will stay only 24hrs after that back to 15secs. Brightness also good"", ""Here's my review after 2 weeks of usage-Pros-1. Great look & feel and good build quality.2. Fantastic display- very big with minimal bezels and great colors and sharpness. Brightness in direct sunlight is pretty good.3. Great cameras- Very natural colors and skin tones, with plenty of detail. Good color consistency between the two lenses. Ultrawide is obviously less sharp, but gets the job done. Portrait mode is the champion feature here. DSLR like shots, especially in the 2x mode. Low light photos are quite good and sharp too, but with less accurate white balance. Selfie camera also is amazing with high level of detail and good skin tones. Video clarity is also amazing, with surprisingly good zoom details.4. Excellent Audio- sound quality from the dual speakers is amazing with surprising amount of bass, clarity and stereo separation. Also mic recording quality is excellent, records in stereo as it has dual mics.5. Good Call quality - absolutely no problems. Its great.6. Network - Was getting network pretty much everywhere I travelled and good thing is that internet speed was pretty good even in traffic situations.7. Fantastic Battery life and charging-  After proper full charge, Lasts almost two dayson normal usage. Stand by is amazing, lost only 2-3% whole night. On heavy usage, easily can reach the next day with 2-3 hours worth of charge left.It is a charging beast, completes charging from 0 to 100 in 30-35 minutes, great for busy days. But make sure to keep the charging on until you receive a battery charge completed notification, otherwise you will experience slightly faster battery discharge.8. Fantastic Performance- Handles daily tasks like its nothing. I am not a gamer, but usually I tend to open and use multiple apps at once, like teams, uber, ola, maps and youtube music, and the phone doesn't break a sweat, handles it like a champ. Apps also open really fast. Observed little to no bugs or lags.9. Nice extras-Great premium haptic feedback nicely integrated with the UI.IR blaster is a nice addition.Bumper case included in the box is pretty nice with raised corners to protect the display, but can get dirty and attract stains pretty easily.3 months of additional warranty.Fast delivery by amazon.Cons-1. Video stabilization is not that great, can be improved.2. Zoom shots have too much contrast and appear a little too artificial, you actually see better details in view finder before taking the photo.3. Slow photo processing. If you take a moving shot or a burst shot, it will skip processing to freeze the action and will not have the same quality as a fully processed image.4. No official display protection. Some websites specify it is a panda glass, but still better to have a tempered screen guard.5. No headphone jack, which is a bummer. Should have in this price range.6. Missing app-opening animations, making the UI feel basic.7. Only 2 years of OS updates. It should be minimum 3 in this price range.8. No official IP rating, although it can handle small splashes of water drops and dust. At this price, it should be at least official.Conclusion-If you want a reliable all-rounder, you can easily go for Nord CE 4. I am fully satisfied with my purchase.

In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer."", 'Great experience to all performanceDisplay 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 5/5Best processor in segmentCamera awesome pictureThis is a good option for all one person found this helpful😎😎😊 Dame true experience to all use Mobile features', ""I'm blown away by how fast this phone is. Runs mostly game at max settings without heating up. The 144Hz screen is super smooth, and the design feels premium despite being plastic. Totally worth it for gamers! The AMOLED display is bright and colorful, and everything feels very fluid. Funtouch OS is much improved. Only downside – camera could be better in very low light, but it's fine for daily use."", 'Everything is good but the selfie camera is extremely bad .A 7k phone has  better selfie camera then this.The speaker is ok but some video and audio sound hurts a little to hear , the whats app video call quality is also extremely poor even a 6k phone will perform better. App install and update speed is not optimize properly even after 3 months', 'I’ve got this for my wife and she is using the iQOO Neo 10R 5G (Moonlight variant) for a few weeks now, and it’s been an impressive experience overall. The performance is blazing fast — apps load instantly, multitasking is smooth, and gaming is lag-free thanks to the Snapdragon chipset. Screen size is 6.78 Amoled display so it give great experience watching online content. It has ample storage capacity so can store multiple pictures and videos.The display is crisp, vibrant, and perfect for streaming or gaming. Battery life easily lasts a full day, and the fast charging is a real time-saver. The Moonlight finish looks sleek and premium — definitely stands out.If I had to nitpick, I’d say the phone feels slightly on the heavier side, especially during prolonged use. But honestly, it’s a small trade-off for the build quality and features packed in.For the price, this is a powerful, stylish phone that punches well above its weight.

I am coming from A52s phone - I have used flagship phones too but I realized they are overkill for my usage so I stopped buying expensive phones. Here are my thoughts on A55:1) Display - Less vibrant than previous A series phones as far as colors are concerned. This display produces more natural colors & I think this is good. No outdoor visibility issues. Bezels are a bit thicker but the quality of display compensates for that. Give it some time you will forget bezels.2) Sound - Nothing to complain, they do their job quite well - both top and bottom speakers sound equal quality & volume wise.3) Network & connectivity - Call quality very good, I was a bit concerned it might have problems with network strength as many people complain of Exynos based phones, fortunately this doesn't have any issues at least where I live and go  - note that I use LTE only mode and not 5G. I would get better idea when I will encounter low network areas. Wifi is also solid, Samsung gave dual band antennas unlike A52s which had single band - due to which speed was limited to 50mbps on wifi - glad the A55 gives full wifi speeds! Bluetooth works well as expected. When I connect my amplifier through bluetooth the phone automatically choose Aptx codec. LDAC codec is also supported if you have LDAC device. A52s was limited to AAC.4) Build and in-hand feel - We are getting such premium quality hardware in lower priced phones is big thumbs up. The phone is little heavy but you will get used to it. The back glass is slippery to hold in hand - you will definitely need case or at least a skin for better grip.5) Software - Transfering data from A52s to A55 was breeze with Samsung smart switch app, I transferred 50gb+ data around 15 mins via usb c to c offline - it retained all settings too! For Whatsapp - I had to manually transfer (You can copy whatsapp folder from old phone to new phone and when you go to activate whatsapp it will ask you to restore that data. Only lost 1 day of data, otherwise everything transferred successfully).About One UI - Probably best software experience with tons of features and customization options! Got Android 15 based One UI 7 just on 21st May a few days back. Samsung is late with Android update this year because Google released Android 16 developer builds quite early last year so Samsung had to work simultaneously on both 15 & 16. They have proven track record of timely updates and I think they will get it right soon. Only major android update came late but security patches have been timely. 4 OS and upto 5 years of security updates makes this phone future proof, you will be good till 2029!6) Battery - It's too good! Check screenshot I get 10+ hours sot. It's easy 2+ days backup for me on normal apps usage. As I just updated to One UI 7 it's in learning mode, I am expecting improvement. I will update the review. For charging I use my old 15w Samsung charger which charges 15-100% in 1:30 hrs. 25w charger should do full charge in 1 hour.7) Performance - Exynos 1480 is no slouch, it performs admirably without any major hiccups. I had some occassional slutters in One ui 6.1 but after one UI 7 it has improved - the overall experience is smoother, more responsive. This is not performance oriented phone so if you multitask a lot, play heavy games then look for other phones. For normal user this is more than enough. No heating at all - it hardly gets warm!8) Camera - I haven't used camera enough to share any judgement but initial impressions are quite positive. Check Youtube videos for better idea - I did and I liked what all of the cameras offer. Nothing to complain.9) Price & value - It was launched at ₹40K last year in March 24, I bought for ₹23700 in recent summer sale. It's always best to avoid buying at launch and wait for price drop next year.Overall A55 is a balanced phone that doesn't lack in any aspect & it's possibly the best VFM phone from Samsung right now!--Suggestions to get best performance & battery backup:1) Use LTE only network mode instead of 5g or automatic.2) Disable wifi, bluetooth, location scanning features and use them only when needed.3) Remove unnecessary apps and disable features you don't use.4) Settings - Google - All Service - disable data sharing features like usage & diagnostics etc.5) Disable Google contact sync. Manually synch it when needed so it won't drain battery in background.This should be enough to improve battery for most users.For advance users - you can get 20-30% more improvement in battery and noticeable performance increment by debloating. Check xdaforums for safe to remove and safe to disable One UI apps & services list."", ""I chose the Galaxy A55 bcz I got it at\xa0 ₹25,500 and it offered a great balance of build quality, software, and performance at a fair price.

If they are expecting box pack mobile then why not pay full price of old model rather than 500 or 1000 rupees. This was my 3rd experience where Amazon rejected exchange.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.', 'Phone features are aside, the best thing is One Plus give always the complete package.

The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞"", ""I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience."", ""Everything is on point as expected. But there are 1 or 2 things i want to share.1. Metal edges are little bit on sharp side so without cover it is difficult to use.2.

( Rating - 4.7 / 5.0 )This Device is not very tall or wide, perfectly in size for grip and hold. Very Lightweight (180 Grams) and slim to carry inside your pocket and you won't fell that you are carrying any bulky thing inside. That is the reason I must recommend this device for office or business persons. Now, I will try to elaborate all the details and specs about this device briefly and try to analyze all the positive and negative points about this device.Specs Details :-------------------1. ( Display Quality ) - 6.7 '' Display as I mentioned it earlier not too tall or too wide, perfect in size for gripping. Looks Premium when you watch any 4K HDR videos on You tube. Not fully Curved, everything is visible on extreme either under or upper surface of the screen. Gamers also can use this device and will not be disappointed. Variation of colors look pragmatic, feel worthy to watch from any angle.Rating - 5/52. (Battery Life ) - 6000 MAH Battery lasts for 1.5 day for moderate use, 2 Days for light use and 1 day for heavy use. This will vary user to user not specific for everyone.Heavy Usage - S.O.T (Screen on Time ) - 6+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 16+ Hrs.Moderate Usage - S.O.T - 8+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 24+ Hrs.Light Usage - S.O.T - 10+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 30+ Hrs.Rating - 5/53. (Charging Speed) - There are options, if enabled device will charge rapidly with the given 80w Charger ( 5 % - 95% within 45 mins ). Smart charging option is also available in which battery will stop charging after 80%.Rating - 4.7/54. ( Heating Issue ) - Not heated at all. If someone will write a review and tell others that the device will heated up during charging then he or she might not aware of the technology. If you will use 30W + adapter while charging any device in this whole universe will get heated naturally. Now, think about 120W adapter -_- . As I mentioned ( not heated at all ) means will not cross 40 degree in any circumstances. and 28 - 39 Degree is vary from summer to winter and the place where you are using it. if you are using it in extreme sunlight it will touch 38. That's not mean the device is internally heated.5. (CPU & RAM Management) - Maximum Clocked at 2.6 GHZ , Dual channel LPDDR4X RAM and UFS 3.1 provide you much batter experience within this budget. Some Device is providing LPDDR5 & UFS 2.2 within this segment but in reality storage speed matters a lot than the RAM. (Before buying you have to understand the difference among LPDDR4X, LPDDR5 & LPDDR5X). Video Rendering and Game Loading is excellent. Out of 10 apps, it will retain 8 apps in RAM after 10 mins. Which is quite well balanced within this budget. Antutu Score is above 750K.Rating - 4.8 / 56. ( Smoothness ) - Buttery Smooth and no mistouches as it comes with curved display.Rating - 5/57. ( Camera Quality ) - SONY IMX 882 50 MP clicks good photos in indoor and outdoor. 2x normal and 5x digitally  zoom options are available. Night photos are also  natural not over contrasty or brighter. Detailing in portrait mode is also great. Edge detection is up to the mark.

Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞"", ""I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience."", ""Everything is on point as expected. But there are 1 or 2 things i want to share.1. Metal edges are little bit on sharp side so without cover it is difficult to use.2. If you live in warm area, it really gets hot and i found frame skips, but that was one time in 1 year of use.3.

Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

Wished they provided usb c to headphone jack adaptor too for some of the older folks how like to use wired headphones.First thing when I held the device was how light it felt in hand. Comparing with Nothing Phone 2 and S22 Ultra it felt super handy and light weight.Design wise, I liked it very much. Simple yet elegant looks, very comfortable in using also. Camera island is the highlight of the device and looks evident that IQOO team had given a lot of thought in designing. Having a boxy design helps in grip. Device sits nicely in hand and feels like a solid device. Still I would suggest a good case for better grip and protection. I ordered white colour and it looks just beautiful. BMW lines are now replaced with BMW stripe logo which gives an elegant and rich looks to the device. Side buttons are nicely positioned and are tactile and clicky.Display, in one word it's awesome. I have used a lot flagships and can say it's not at all inferior. It's a puch hole display and punch hole is moderately large in size. If it could been smaller in size it would have been brilliant. Brightness is very good and it's easily visible evev in bright sun. Colours look rich. Not a technical expert but can say display looks pleasent and wonderful. It's 1.5k display and looks quite sharp. You won't miss 2k much, to be honest I feel fhd+ is more then enough for mobile displays. Along with brightness, display can go ultra dim too. Turn on extra dim option from quick setting toggle to lower brightness even further if required.Processor wise, it have latest and fastest snapdragon processor, SD 8 Gen 3. Thanks to the processor device is extremely smooth and lag free. Scrolling, switching apps, multitasking, gaming all are quite fast and one can feel the difference if coming from 2 generation old flagship device or any mid range device.Regular usage doesn't heat up device at all. I was using S22 Ultra before this and it regularly got hot even in day to day tasks. But  IQOO 12 didn't heat up like that. In a week of usage of my handset never experienced any heating issues or hangups in device.Software wise, it's quite a good experience compared to older version of OS. As the IQOO team promised no hot app or hot games, it's not completely true. Once you open Vivo store app all the apps pop up but this time they can be removed. Few bloatware and duplicate apps are present too. But after removing bloatwares and disabling or muting notifications of apps you don't require experience gets pretty good.UI looks have been revamped and now it looks modern. IQOO/Vivo now needs to revamp their home launcher app. It lacks a lot of features like hidding apps, secure folder to name a few. Installing third party home launcher solves these issues but many widgets become unusable like weather, album etc. Dynamic effects also gets disabled on third party launcher which is a bummer.Battery life is quite good. Light usage can give you 2 days battery life easily. Moderate usage leaves you with 40% to 50% battery at the end of the day and heavy usage should leave you with 10% to 20% easily.Overall SoT on moderate usage which I got was around 8 hrs to 9 hrs. Charging is super fast with in the box 120w charger. Phone gets fully charged in less then half an hour. If they would have given wireless charging support too, it would have been great. But not much to miss though.All the required sensors are present like nfc, gyro, accelerometer and all works fine. No issues in proximity sensor also. Speakers are good not the best but much better then average.Using on 5G jio in Hyderabad, great reception and signal strength. No heating also even on 5G network (Moto edge 40 had this issue).Haptics are also very good not Apple level but very good still. Implemented very nicely and can be felt in all the places like typing, general scrolling etc.I am surprised why IQOO team chose to give usb 2.0 port for data transfer. I usually transfer files from mobile to pc and vice versa regularly. Having restricted speed means a lot of time for transfer. I didn't thought of it as a deal breaker but after usage I can say it is a deal breaker.Camera section is something where I don't have much experience. I don't use camera much. But whatever pics I have clicked gave very good results. For most it should be more then enough. For professional analysis look elsewhere. Daylight and night time shots boty came out pretty good for me. I am just point and click type of shooter😅.All in all I can easily recommend this device to any person who want a super fast device with stable os experience.

I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade. ( I hope vivo and iqoo bring custom rom support because that would be great to have like poco and oneplus ).Pros* Good camera for the price could be bit better in video.* One of the best gaming phones does heat up but in a controlled way and cools down pretty fast.* Really Fast charging speed ( does heat a bit nothing to bother or just open settings - battery - charging and disable fast charging it will slightly slow down charging speed but it will decrease phone's surface temp ).* Good display very bright overall really goodscreen.* Very good after sale service ( disclaimer had experience with previous phone iqoo Neo 6 regarding screen replacement bit pricey but really good experience and very fast.Cons* Mediocre Selfie camera my old IQoo Neo 6 had better selfie's than this paid 55k for a phone and no 4k Selfie video front is the biggest downside of this phone.* UI is good very reliable but not as good as other Android Skins ( Just updated to android 15 did make a way better and smoother but could be better).* And audio transmitter has kinda bad the output is not upto to the mark with bluetooh specifically had same problem with my Neo 6 my poco f1 had really good audio Dec on board than this two new phones.Overall - 4.4/5This is rating is based on my experience, and also to point out I'm very heavy user, so the fact that it is able to keep up with demands is actually very commendable, And a brief disclaimer I am a long term iqoo user been using iqoo brand since 2022 but overall the phone is really good and has impressed me. That's the reason I'm taking my time and giving a review here.Quick updateAnd BTW regarding updating your phone I still stand by NOT UPDATING YOUR PHONE, but I have updated to android 15 I did reasearch thoroughly and decided update because there were a lot improvement and I don't plan on updating after this update ( So the phone is on android 15 Nov security patch )."", 'Performance next level,  Camera quality, first charging ,', 'Hello.

( I hope vivo and iqoo bring custom rom support because that would be great to have like poco and oneplus ).Pros* Good camera for the price could be bit better in video.* One of the best gaming phones does heat up but in a controlled way and cools down pretty fast.* Really Fast charging speed ( does heat a bit nothing to bother or just open settings - battery - charging and disable fast charging it will slightly slow down charging speed but it will decrease phone's surface temp ).* Good display very bright overall really goodscreen.* Very good after sale service ( disclaimer had experience with previous phone iqoo Neo 6 regarding screen replacement bit pricey but really good experience and very fast.Cons* Mediocre Selfie camera my old IQoo Neo 6 had better selfie's than this paid 55k for a phone and no 4k Selfie video front is the biggest downside of this phone.* UI is good very reliable but not as good as other Android Skins ( Just updated to android 15 did make a way better and smoother but could be better).* And audio transmitter has kinda bad the output is not upto to the mark with bluetooh specifically had same problem with my Neo 6 my poco f1 had really good audio Dec on board than this two new phones.Overall - 4.4/5This is rating is based on my experience, and also to point out I'm very heavy user, so the fact that it is able to keep up with demands is actually very commendable, And a brief disclaimer I am a long term iqoo user been using iqoo brand since 2022 but overall the phone is really good and has impressed me. That's the reason I'm taking my time and giving a review here.Quick updateAnd BTW regarding updating your phone I still stand by NOT UPDATING YOUR PHONE, but I have updated to android 15 I did reasearch thoroughly and decided update because there were a lot improvement and I don't plan on updating after this update ( So the phone is on android 15 Nov security patch )."", 'Performance next level,  Camera quality, first charging ,', 'Hello.

And I am absolutely loving it! If you are trying to decide if it is a good phone, it definitely is. OnePlus is offering a 7k exchange bonus till Jan-end, so you can toss away any old working or non-working phone to get a decent discount. With the exchange and Republic Day offers, I got it for around 60K which I feel is a steal. I got the Midnight Ocean variant especially for the textured blue back and it does feel premium.I preferred OP13 over the awesome Samsung S23 ultra mainly because Samsung is not extending the OS updates promise like it did for S24 ultra. Being released this year, OP13 should get at least 4 years of OS updates.DISPLAYThe ProXDR QXD+ LTPO AMOLED display is amazing as expected. In direct sunlight you may need to increase the brightness to near full. The 120Hz refresh rate gives flicker-free screen transitions. Color reproduction is great too. I keep the Always-On display mode that I fell in love with on my previous Pixel. The edge-to-edge display with mildly bent edges and corners offers a lot of real estate. It's a relatively big phone but is not that heavy and can comfortably fit a men's jeans pocket.HARDWAREThe Snapdragon Elite is really snappy! No issues running anything or even many things. I am not a gamer, but have not experienced any heating issues so far. Apart from the 16GB RAM, it adds another virtual 12GB RAM making it a whopping 30GB RAM beast. The half a TB of RAM is almost fully available for shooting hi-res videos or loading big games as the OS and apps occupy less than 50GB of space. It comes with two nano SIM slots. Of course  it supports eSIMs too, but guess you can have only upto two active at a time. Apart from the usual sensors that are standard in most phones nowadays, it comes with a Color temperature sensor, Compass, Ultrasonic fingerprint, Hall sensor, Laser focus sensor, Spectral sensors and Infrared remote control. It also supports the latest standards in most areas - Bluetooth 5.4, WiFi 7, NFC and all GPS systems including NavIC. There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases.

I am coming from A52s phone - I have used flagship phones too but I realized they are overkill for my usage so I stopped buying expensive phones. Here are my thoughts on A55:1) Display - Less vibrant than previous A series phones as far as colors are concerned. This display produces more natural colors & I think this is good. No outdoor visibility issues. Bezels are a bit thicker but the quality of display compensates for that. Give it some time you will forget bezels.2) Sound - Nothing to complain, they do their job quite well - both top and bottom speakers sound equal quality & volume wise.3) Network & connectivity - Call quality very good, I was a bit concerned it might have problems with network strength as many people complain of Exynos based phones, fortunately this doesn't have any issues at least where I live and go  - note that I use LTE only mode and not 5G. I would get better idea when I will encounter low network areas. Wifi is also solid, Samsung gave dual band antennas unlike A52s which had single band - due to which speed was limited to 50mbps on wifi - glad the A55 gives full wifi speeds! Bluetooth works well as expected. When I connect my amplifier through bluetooth the phone automatically choose Aptx codec. LDAC codec is also supported if you have LDAC device. A52s was limited to AAC.4) Build and in-hand feel - We are getting such premium quality hardware in lower priced phones is big thumbs up. The phone is little heavy but you will get used to it. The back glass is slippery to hold in hand - you will definitely need case or at least a skin for better grip.5) Software - Transfering data from A52s to A55 was breeze with Samsung smart switch app, I transferred 50gb+ data around 15 mins via usb c to c offline - it retained all settings too! For Whatsapp - I had to manually transfer (You can copy whatsapp folder from old phone to new phone and when you go to activate whatsapp it will ask you to restore that data. Only lost 1 day of data, otherwise everything transferred successfully).About One UI - Probably best software experience with tons of features and customization options! Got Android 15 based One UI 7 just on 21st May a few days back. Samsung is late with Android update this year because Google released Android 16 developer builds quite early last year so Samsung had to work simultaneously on both 15 & 16. They have proven track record of timely updates and I think they will get it right soon. Only major android update came late but security patches have been timely. 4 OS and upto 5 years of security updates makes this phone future proof, you will be good till 2029!6) Battery - It's too good! Check screenshot I get 10+ hours sot. It's easy 2+ days backup for me on normal apps usage. As I just updated to One UI 7 it's in learning mode, I am expecting improvement. I will update the review. For charging I use my old 15w Samsung charger which charges 15-100% in 1:30 hrs. 25w charger should do full charge in 1 hour.7) Performance - Exynos 1480 is no slouch, it performs admirably without any major hiccups. I had some occassional slutters in One ui 6.1 but after one UI 7 it has improved - the overall experience is smoother, more responsive. This is not performance oriented phone so if you multitask a lot, play heavy games then look for other phones. For normal user this is more than enough. No heating at all - it hardly gets warm!8) Camera - I haven't used camera enough to share any judgement but initial impressions are quite positive. Check Youtube videos for better idea - I did and I liked what all of the cameras offer. Nothing to complain.9) Price & value - It was launched at ₹40K last year in March 24, I bought for ₹23700 in recent summer sale. It's always best to avoid buying at launch and wait for price drop next year.Overall A55 is a balanced phone that doesn't lack in any aspect & it's possibly the best VFM phone from Samsung right now!--Suggestions to get best performance & battery backup:1) Use LTE only network mode instead of 5g or automatic.2) Disable wifi, bluetooth, location scanning features and use them only when needed.3) Remove unnecessary apps and disable features you don't use.4) Settings - Google - All Service - disable data sharing features like usage & diagnostics etc.5) Disable Google contact sync. Manually synch it when needed so it won't drain battery in background.This should be enough to improve battery for most users.For advance users - you can get 20-30% more improvement in battery and noticeable performance increment by debloating. Check xdaforums for safe to remove and safe to disable One UI apps & services list."", ""I chose the Galaxy A55 bcz I got it at\xa0 ₹25,500 and it offered a great balance of build quality, software, and performance at a fair price. It felt more premium and reliable compared to others in the same range.Performance & DisplayPerformance is smooth , and it only heats slightly during charging and gaming simultaneously—nothing serious. The display is vibrant and sharp, great for media and outdoor use.Battery & ChargingBattery life is decent for a day’s use, but 25W charging is slower than many competitors. It is the only problemCameraThe camera is fine for casual use, but don’t expect flagship-level shots.Build & ValueThe phone feels premium and sturdy in hand, though a little bit on the heavier side. Overall, at this price, it's definitely good value for money.Charging speed:SlowBattery life:OkFeatures:GoodFeel:GreatPerformance:Ok to good (for Exynos)Heating issue:Only when you charge and game at same time"", ""Samsung A55 mobile is good. With Launching of A56 price had dropped by over 10K. It is still worth, recently got One UI 7 and Android 15 upgrade. Camera and battery quality are both good.I ordered with exchange however the delivery person deliberately found scratches on screen and phone. I don't understand Amazon exchange policy. If they are expecting box pack mobile then why not pay full price of old model rather than 500 or 1000 rupees. This was my 3rd experience where Amazon rejected exchange. Amazon seriously need to set clear guidelines for exchange and be transparent in their policy. My opinion is not to purchase with Amazon exchange rather give mobile your helper someone needy."", ""Great phone under 30k..I bought the 256gb variant at 29k in Summer sale.. it's an almost perfect phone..Camera: 9/10 [Very Good Camera Setup and it doesn't struggle in most of the cases, selfie cam is not good at all..

I contacted Amazon customer support, followed by Motorola customer support, who confirmed that it is likely a hardware defect and advised me to visit the nearest service center for a replacement.However, upon visiting the Motorola service center, I was informed that they would only repair the device instead of providing a replacement. The repair process would take 5 to 7 days, which is completely unacceptable for a brand-new phone.

Sometimes the call gets cut automatically, sometimes you can't dial etc etc...you.have to keep tampering with the mobile data and wifi by turning them off or on and try various combinations before it works again. This again might seem like a small issue but hampers the experience a lot.3) Wifi and hotspot : You can't turn on the WiFi and the hotspot at the same time which might be a problem for some.

If you are a guy with optimum usage no games and all or you are a guy with heavy games and editing, it will be a butter smooth experience , not tried 144fps will update later .one thing is 2.4 million antutu score is experienced only on 16gb variant not on all devices mentioned in their website itself I felt to share with you all.BGMI : first of all there is no such fps shifting from 120 to 90 so pls don't believe on that rumour, second thing bgmi runs like butter on both 90 and 120 fps and no such noticable heatings even after 5 hrs or more gaming. Talking about battery, per tdm costs 1% battery, 1 hr of proper chicken dinner classic match will drain upto 10-15% battery, mine lasts 30-40 mins and it drain 9-10% which is good for me . There is no poor screen recordings so feel free to buy for bgmiBattery: it comes with 7000mah and with 120 w adapter, normal use lasts for 2 days with 12hr+ screen time and bgmi will run approx 8-9 hrs I have not tested it but played 5-6 hrs straight and it went upto 35 % u can expect more 2-3 hrs easily. Charging speed is really fast and exactly what iqoo claims so no worries about that .Camera : camera is good tbh not a camera centric but compared it with iqoo z9s , moto edge 50 fusion and vivo v40 too of my family members. Images are far better than z9s and edge 50 fusion but not so good as vivo v40 and u can expect that but video quality is on next level it's actually blew me its better than all other three . I will advise use 4k30fpsDisplay: colour full and bright. No problem in using it under direct Sunlight peak brightness is osm .IR blaster is really amazing works perfectly but only thing which lacking in this device is IP rating and titanium colour is actually amazing but I feel it's not giving that premium quality being a 36k phone could have been better. I will suggest those who are searching here for a premium phone with day today normal work , camera and display can go for vivo v40 or pro versionOverall this phone is totally value for money, so happy that I got a device which I really wanted to seen couple of stupid reviews and was changing my decision took a risk and it's worth it . One thing to mention is your fps will drop to 60 fps only when you are on battery saver mode before starting the game or at 75% once you change the fps setting again or disable the battery saver mode you are on 👍. I will surely share some clips and images if you find this review helpful"", 'Battery and charging speed is unmatchable, unbeatable and really really good. I have not seen this capacity of battery and this speed of charging.Camera is having pros also and cons also, like in low light this camera is performing better than apple. Then in potraits photo this camera is stunning and unbeatable. Yes because this a 50mp camera so you can not take heavy zooming photos like Samsung. The wide angle photos and vedios are very poor if you compare with Samsung and apple.Performance is decent because of the Snapdragon 8s Gen4 but also this phone has features to make you feel more faster user experience. I have not seen any phone installing the applications faster than this phone.Display is big and bright. But there is a missing premium feel of touch. Which Samsung gives.I was a Samsung user since last 10 years so I can say that.Every thing else is awesome. This is best mobile phone in this price range. Yes there is a competitor of this phone also which is poco F7.I have uploaded some camera samples also.Himanshu Singh', ""For Gamers, it's a gem of a phone. But you have to keep touch sampling rate as 'Recommended'. If kept as 'High', the battery will drain faster. You will get 110-120 fps on average for BGMI. Camera is above expectation being a gaming phone. For someone who prefers zoomed photography, it's not that good since it doesn't have periscope camera. Otherwise, it takes really good photos. UI is good but could be better. Brightness is also good with features like eye-protection. Sound quantity is also nice and loud, though Dolby Atmos support is not provided.

( Rating - 4.7 / 5.0 )This Device is not very tall or wide, perfectly in size for grip and hold. Very Lightweight (180 Grams) and slim to carry inside your pocket and you won't fell that you are carrying any bulky thing inside. That is the reason I must recommend this device for office or business persons. Now, I will try to elaborate all the details and specs about this device briefly and try to analyze all the positive and negative points about this device.Specs Details :-------------------1. ( Display Quality ) - 6.7 '' Display as I mentioned it earlier not too tall or too wide, perfect in size for gripping. Looks Premium when you watch any 4K HDR videos on You tube. Not fully Curved, everything is visible on extreme either under or upper surface of the screen. Gamers also can use this device and will not be disappointed. Variation of colors look pragmatic, feel worthy to watch from any angle.Rating - 5/52. (Battery Life ) - 6000 MAH Battery lasts for 1.5 day for moderate use, 2 Days for light use and 1 day for heavy use. This will vary user to user not specific for everyone.Heavy Usage - S.O.T (Screen on Time ) - 6+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 16+ Hrs.Moderate Usage - S.O.T - 8+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 24+ Hrs.Light Usage - S.O.T - 10+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 30+ Hrs.Rating - 5/53. (Charging Speed) - There are options, if enabled device will charge rapidly with the given 80w Charger ( 5 % - 95% within 45 mins ). Smart charging option is also available in which battery will stop charging after 80%.Rating - 4.7/54. ( Heating Issue ) - Not heated at all. If someone will write a review and tell others that the device will heated up during charging then he or she might not aware of the technology. If you will use 30W + adapter while charging any device in this whole universe will get heated naturally. Now, think about 120W adapter -_- . As I mentioned ( not heated at all ) means will not cross 40 degree in any circumstances. and 28 - 39 Degree is vary from summer to winter and the place where you are using it. if you are using it in extreme sunlight it will touch 38. That's not mean the device is internally heated.5. (CPU & RAM Management) - Maximum Clocked at 2.6 GHZ , Dual channel LPDDR4X RAM and UFS 3.1 provide you much batter experience within this budget. Some Device is providing LPDDR5 & UFS 2.2 within this segment but in reality storage speed matters a lot than the RAM. (Before buying you have to understand the difference among LPDDR4X, LPDDR5 & LPDDR5X). Video Rendering and Game Loading is excellent. Out of 10 apps, it will retain 8 apps in RAM after 10 mins. Which is quite well balanced within this budget. Antutu Score is above 750K.Rating - 4.8 / 56. ( Smoothness ) - Buttery Smooth and no mistouches as it comes with curved display.Rating - 5/57. ( Camera Quality ) - SONY IMX 882 50 MP clicks good photos in indoor and outdoor. 2x normal and 5x digitally  zoom options are available. Night photos are also  natural not over contrasty or brighter. Detailing in portrait mode is also great. Edge detection is up to the mark.

Great Phone, it mostly focuses on performance than cameras etc, Basically a gaming phone under 35K(8+256gb is best). Real good performance, features are good. Camera is really not that bad+ its AI (photo edit) is really good (pretty fast with good results) 4K front and rear video recording, 240 fps slo-mo, supermoon, Pano,Long exposure, Night mode. Zero lag, nor in gaming (I am talking about heavy gaming 90-120 fps) neither day to day uses. Smooth and crisp display. Charging is superfast (0-100 in 38 minutes). Homescreen, lock screen effects cam be customized easily. Can even play upto 144 fps in certain games. Has monster mode(voice changer, background calls,split screen etc) but heats slightly when gaming on high environment temp. With 90-120 fps gaming, it heats significantly. For gaming- cooler temperatures are required.Build quality is OK, Plastic Body. IP65 rated (dust and splash proof only.) Shoud have been at least IP37, IP38.', ""Got 12gb  titanium variant on 16 june , here's my 1 week review:PROCESSOR: being a midnight gamer and a student the processor is what I will love the most , trust me not a single complaint. If you are a guy with optimum usage no games and all or you are a guy with heavy games and editing, it will be a butter smooth experience , not tried 144fps will update later .one thing is 2.4 million antutu score is experienced only on 16gb variant not on all devices mentioned in their website itself I felt to share with you all.BGMI : first of all there is no such fps shifting from 120 to 90 so pls don't believe on that rumour, second thing bgmi runs like butter on both 90 and 120 fps and no such noticable heatings even after 5 hrs or more gaming. Talking about battery, per tdm costs 1% battery, 1 hr of proper chicken dinner classic match will drain upto 10-15% battery, mine lasts 30-40 mins and it drain 9-10% which is good for me . There is no poor screen recordings so feel free to buy for bgmiBattery: it comes with 7000mah and with 120 w adapter, normal use lasts for 2 days with 12hr+ screen time and bgmi will run approx 8-9 hrs I have not tested it but played 5-6 hrs straight and it went upto 35 % u can expect more 2-3 hrs easily. Charging speed is really fast and exactly what iqoo claims so no worries about that .Camera : camera is good tbh not a camera centric but compared it with iqoo z9s , moto edge 50 fusion and vivo v40 too of my family members. Images are far better than z9s and edge 50 fusion but not so good as vivo v40 and u can expect that but video quality is on next level it's actually blew me its better than all other three . I will advise use 4k30fpsDisplay: colour full and bright. No problem in using it under direct Sunlight peak brightness is osm .IR blaster is really amazing works perfectly but only thing which lacking in this device is IP rating and titanium colour is actually amazing but I feel it's not giving that premium quality being a 36k phone could have been better. I will suggest those who are searching here for a premium phone with day today normal work , camera and display can go for vivo v40 or pro versionOverall this phone is totally value for money, so happy that I got a device which I really wanted to seen couple of stupid reviews and was changing my decision took a risk and it's worth it . One thing to mention is your fps will drop to 60 fps only when you are on battery saver mode before starting the game or at 75% once you change the fps setting again or disable the battery saver mode you are on 👍. I will surely share some clips and images if you find this review helpful"", 'Battery and charging speed is unmatchable, unbeatable and really really good. I have not seen this capacity of battery and this speed of charging.Camera is having pros also and cons also, like in low light this camera is performing better than apple. Then in potraits photo this camera is stunning and unbeatable. Yes because this a 50mp camera so you can not take heavy zooming photos like Samsung. The wide angle photos and vedios are very poor if you compare with Samsung and apple.Performance is decent because of the Snapdragon 8s Gen4 but also this phone has features to make you feel more faster user experience. I have not seen any phone installing the applications faster than this phone.Display is big and bright. But there is a missing premium feel of touch. Which Samsung gives.I was a Samsung user since last 10 years so I can say that.Every thing else is awesome. This is best mobile phone in this price range. Yes there is a competitor of this phone also which is poco F7.I have uploaded some camera samples also.Himanshu Singh', ""For Gamers, it's a gem of a phone. But you have to keep touch sampling rate as 'Recommended'. If kept as 'High', the battery will drain faster. You will get 110-120 fps on average for BGMI. Camera is above expectation being a gaming phone. For someone who prefers zoomed photography, it's not that good since it doesn't have periscope camera. Otherwise, it takes really good photos. UI is good but could be better. Brightness is also good with features like eye-protection. Sound quantity is also nice and loud, though Dolby Atmos support is not provided. Worth recommended phone unless you are a hardcore photography enthusiastic."", ""It's best for performance, battery and charging. Camera are Normal nothing extraordinary, build quality may be better if given IP 68/69, Display is very Impressive. If you waana Buy it is easily Recommended.

And after using it for more than a month, here's my review.Pros1) exceptional camera quality. The 12MP ultra-wide does it's job and I would say going for 5x optical zoom with 50MP sensor instead for 10x 10MP sensor is a better choice as upto 30x I would say the pictures are more crisp than S23 ultra.2) Build quality is premium. It feels like a high budget smartphone. Not sure if titanium armor is enough to withstand high drop possibilities, but it does make it lighter.3) Screen is a big improvement. The anti reflective Corning Gorilla glass armor does it's job and reflects most of the glare so you can sit easily and watch without worrying if the person sitting next to you is watching coz they can't. 😁3) S-pen has improved a bit. A lot of people are saying that they don't use it much after first time, but that's not the case with me. If you will get the hang of it, you will use it quite often.4) AI interface is quite excellent. Although in initial phase, it does it's job in notes and summarising big pages so that you can easily get the gist.5) 7 years OS and security update is a big big up from my side.6) The box like built rather than a curve display is a better choice. It's easier to find a screen protector.7) sanpdragan 8 gen3 is fast. You can play high end games at maximum capacity. Android 14 with one UI 6 is smooth as you can hope it would be. I haven't recorded any lags or heating issues as for now.Cons1) Anti refective display works until you put  the above mention screen protector. After that it won't work with that precision. Although it still does it's job.2) Selfie camera is still not that great if you're using iPhone 14 or 15 pro.3) generative AI is not that great in calls and photo editing. Also, to pay for these services after 2025 is a big drawback from Samsung.4) Samsung is still not implementing faster charging protocols on their high and mid range smartphones. In a time when OnePlus is offering 100W charging speeds and xiomi offering 50-80W wireless charging, Samsung is still stuck with 45W and 15W wireless charging. Big drawback. However, battery do last for a full day.5) speaking of charging, no charger included is a serious letdown when you're spending more than a lac on a high end smartphone. Samsung, it doesn't feels good. 😔Overall, a good smartphone if you're thinking to go for a big one for a long time."", 'Genuine product : From the sellerS24 ultra is a great upgrade with most featuresGreat built qualityGood looksAwesome screenBetter connectivity  and receptionHandles all the tasks very well  with snapdragon 8 Gen 3ui 7  works like charmCamera  is a good Upgrade from SamsungAi works very well .Definitely I recommend this phablet to any body who is interested in a flag ship .With UI7  mostly heating issues r fixed .

( Rating - 4.7 / 5.0 )This Device is not very tall or wide, perfectly in size for grip and hold. Very Lightweight (180 Grams) and slim to carry inside your pocket and you won't fell that you are carrying any bulky thing inside. That is the reason I must recommend this device for office or business persons. Now, I will try to elaborate all the details and specs about this device briefly and try to analyze all the positive and negative points about this device.Specs Details :-------------------1. ( Display Quality ) - 6.7 '' Display as I mentioned it earlier not too tall or too wide, perfect in size for gripping. Looks Premium when you watch any 4K HDR videos on You tube. Not fully Curved, everything is visible on extreme either under or upper surface of the screen. Gamers also can use this device and will not be disappointed. Variation of colors look pragmatic, feel worthy to watch from any angle.Rating - 5/52. (Battery Life ) - 6000 MAH Battery lasts for 1.5 day for moderate use, 2 Days for light use and 1 day for heavy use. This will vary user to user not specific for everyone.Heavy Usage - S.O.T (Screen on Time ) - 6+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 16+ Hrs.Moderate Usage - S.O.T - 8+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 24+ Hrs.Light Usage - S.O.T - 10+ Hrs. , Overall Time - 30+ Hrs.Rating - 5/53. (Charging Speed) - There are options, if enabled device will charge rapidly with the given 80w Charger ( 5 % - 95% within 45 mins ). Smart charging option is also available in which battery will stop charging after 80%.Rating - 4.7/54. ( Heating Issue ) - Not heated at all. If someone will write a review and tell others that the device will heated up during charging then he or she might not aware of the technology. If you will use 30W + adapter while charging any device in this whole universe will get heated naturally. Now, think about 120W adapter -_- . As I mentioned ( not heated at all ) means will not cross 40 degree in any circumstances. and 28 - 39 Degree is vary from summer to winter and the place where you are using it. if you are using it in extreme sunlight it will touch 38. That's not mean the device is internally heated.5. (CPU & RAM Management) - Maximum Clocked at 2.6 GHZ , Dual channel LPDDR4X RAM and UFS 3.1 provide you much batter experience within this budget. Some Device is providing LPDDR5 & UFS 2.2 within this segment but in reality storage speed matters a lot than the RAM. (Before buying you have to understand the difference among LPDDR4X, LPDDR5 & LPDDR5X). Video Rendering and Game Loading is excellent. Out of 10 apps, it will retain 8 apps in RAM after 10 mins. Which is quite well balanced within this budget. Antutu Score is above 750K.Rating - 4.8 / 56. ( Smoothness ) - Buttery Smooth and no mistouches as it comes with curved display.Rating - 5/57. ( Camera Quality ) - SONY IMX 882 50 MP clicks good photos in indoor and outdoor. 2x normal and 5x digitally  zoom options are available. Night photos are also  natural not over contrasty or brighter. Detailing in portrait mode is also great. Edge detection is up to the mark. Overall nice within this range. you can not accept very high camera quality under 20k.Rating - 4.8 / 5Overall, balanced phone in every aspect and comes with IP rating 66 68 & 69.

My initial experience was great, but after a few months, I started to feel the phone's performance getting hit, which was a shock as Samsung promised 5 years of OS updates and it got a degraded performance just in a few month's time. Also, the phone was heating up pretty badly even with a short span of gaming and drained the battery. Then I decided to switch ASAP as the Amazon GIF was about to start and picked the Glacial white colour and looks luxurious. Also got the OnePlus Buds pro 2 worth 9k totally free.To begin with, I was a bit confused to purchase OnePlus phone with all the green lines & motherboard fiasco. After a heavy research, I convinced myself to purchase the phone. Till now the phone has been performing great and I am happy. My experience is drafted as pointers below:1. Size of the phone - Yes, it is a big & heavy phone an might need some tine to get used to it. I have big hands and I felt convenient holding it. The camera module is a bit bulky, but this issue got resolved after I slapped on a Ringke case.2. Performance - After purchasing, you have to give it a few days to adjust to your daily routines, charging habits etc. an you will notice some mild heating with some jitters in the UI. But after that the phone is now buttery smooth and I just love the way the animations work. Only time you can feel some heat is during the camera use and charging. I play PES 2025 occasionally and it was smooth.3. Cameras - Yes, Samsung did have a great set of cameras, but got degraded with updates. As of now OnePlus 12 takes good photos. The macro& portrait shots are excellent. Hope they keep improving on this. Videos are also good enough. Selfie camera here is still not upto the mark & Samsung wins in the selfie section.4. Battery & Charging - This department really takes my breath away. My battery anxiety has gone down now. I easily get more than 7hrs of SOT & 100W charger is extremely fast and saves my time. Samsung literally lost in this department face down.5. Screen - It's a 2k OLED curved screen manufactured by BOE that is bright enough with 1600 Nits of HBM. I could easily read under direct sunlight and the LTPO display with the adaptive refresh rate works like a charm. This is my first curved screen experience and still getting used to it, but does look premium.6. Build quality - The phone is sturdy with Gorilla glass victus 2 in from & gorilla glass in the back. It holds firmly in your hands, but us a case as it is slippery.7. OS - One UI is really good, loaded with features. Oxygen OS is now Color OS and has lost it's Oxygen OS feel. But the OS is lighter than One UI which makes the SD8gen3 chipset snappier. It also has a few tricks up its sleeve and is very handy. (P.S. - Happy to see the 3 fingers screenshot, as Samsung did miss this.)Some cons that I noticed:1. They could have give IP68 at this price.2. The cameral initially seems a bit off, but once you get used to its working mode, zoom style etc., then it will be fine.3. Since I come from Samsung, I feel that some features in Samsung could have been implemented here also (like modes & routines, AI image editor).4. Since the Greenline issues & motherboard issue persists in almost all phone brands, better take in the extended warranty at Rs 999.5. Getting a screen protector is still a challenge. I have installed a skin to avoid scratches.The buds are also working fine and has a great audio signature.Hopefully this phone lasts for me well. Will keep you all posted in case of any updates. (I am using the Ringke Camo back cover which sits perfectly with the phone, just FYI)Thank you!Update on 14 Oct 2024 - The phone is still performing well and the battery life is remarkable. For people looking for a good case, please select the Ringke case for Oneplus 12 as it has a better screen protection and holding grip. I took the camouflage version as it's back is not a fingerprint magnet.Thank you."", 'file transfer speed is around 200 to 350mbps using type c to type cwill update with further info later', ""Hey I purchased this new recently, and when I unboxed and booted it up. I found small blue spots on display. This was a brand new phone we talking. I bought because price was good, but didn't knew being cheap means it'll have these issues. Talked to amazon and they told me to visit service center, as they can't help on such issues. Now service center has given me 7-10 days timeframe and kept phone with them. Hopefully will replace with new but I don't know. And I've to go through all this after purchasing brand new from amazon.

This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don\'t have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can\'t use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things.', 'As expected', '\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e .', 'Superb I’m satisfied', '👌', 'Love the phone and it’s purely original I received other platform sell copy phone but its very good.

Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .THE BATTERY is big changes grade , you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me . The charging is capped to 25w but you have to buy the charger separately... but charging speed is fine . No complains on that .THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (₹18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone ."", 'The package came with a tear just big enough to pull out the box from within. I was suspicious but the seal on the box was intact and seemed untouched. So I accepted it.The phone functions smoothly and the colors are crisp. It feels bulky though. Battery easily lasts for a day on a single charge. I got it for mom so it seems pretty reliable for normal usage.', ""Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens."", ""Best if you get this in 13499 and go for Samsung original charger cost around 1000 it charge phone in very less time as compared to any normal charger and best cover is spign essential kit you'll get it for 599 something or only spign sand blast cover cost 700CONCLUSION:- I AM SURE YOU HAVE WATCHED REVIEW OF THIS PHONE DONT THINK MUCH PURCHASE IF GETTING FOR 13500 BECAUSE ACCESORIES WILL MAKE WHOLE FIGURE 15000 OR MORE SOMETIME HOPE IT HELP"", 'Cellulare molto bello .', 'Good Products', 'Very good seller and good quality device... i recommended this seller', 'Highly recommended', 'Es un Samsung, ya con eso poco queda ya por decir, lo compré para mi madre, elegí éste modelo porque podía ponerle el modo sencillo ,solo con lo más básico, y le va bien, pero Samsung debería pensar más en las personas con problemas de audición y tener un modo para ello, el volumen podría ser más alto, he tenido que descargarle una aplicación para ponerle los tonos de llamada más alto, por lo demás, llegó en perfectas condiciones, se ve la calidad y la batería dura mucho.']",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.3234285714285714,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PlVwPxFRL._SX679_.jpg

The Visuals of the Display are vivid & an eye feast to watch videos.The Best part is the camera of the phone ( 50MP Portrait  + 50MP Telephoto lens + 12MP Wide  & 50MP Selfie camera ) . The best camera setup in the price segment. What I love the most is the Honor has collaborated with Studio Harcourt renewed for capturing Portraits of Hollywood Stars & Celebrities. They together brought 3 stunning filters to capture studio level portraits. I have shared a few pictures captured using the Harcourt filters. The output is stunningly marvelous.  Posting them directly. No filters added & no colour correction done.  Most importantly we don't  have any photography skills. It's all the magic of the Camera & Harcourt Filters.If you are looking for the Phone to capture best Portraits , Honor200 is Undoubtedly the best choice.The Telephoto lens is outstanding . you could capture crisp photos even in 50X Zoom.The last 4 pictures , I have attached are captured from the same spot ( Ultrawide , 1X , 10X & 50X Zoom )  You could see the names of the boards captured clearly in 50X zoom.Coming to the selfie camera , you could capture beautiful selfies with 50MP selfie camera.you could record 4K videos using both Rear & Front camera . Dula video recording , slow motion video recording , Time lapse , Solo cut are the other camera options you could found.In Camera Department ,  Honor 200 is the complete package.Apart from the camera Yu can have the Honor Eye comfort Display with 3840Hz PWM Dimming for utmost eye care.Silicon -Carbob Battery with 5200mAh with 100W Wired charging .The UI is so smooth with Magic OS 8.0. The best part with Magic OS is , it pefectly synchronizes with the Hardware of the phone & you will never faces any issue with performance.I have been using Honor20 from the past 5 years & it still working like a charm , not even once I faced an issue like phone lagging . Thanks to Magic OS.There are so many Ai features that could make your life so easier with daily tasks. .I am not a Hardcore gamer .

The camera takes crystal clear images.I had been using honor mobile since 8 years...as I needed a better upgrade..chosen this one..and I am liking it.Battery life is decent...lasts one and a half dayRecommended', ""The media could not be loaded.Such a superb device packed with bundle of very needful features that are helpful in every day work.I LOVE HONOR!!! The honor devices comes always with great features. Previously i used honor 4X it was  went for more than 4 years then switched to realme and now again after 5 years came to Honor. Honor devices are too good in camera quality than any other phones. Here are detailed review of honor 200 after using 4 months.1. Camera (4.7) :- its not a camera its an AI camera which is too smart that can detect type of image you are taking and prompt you accordingly. Crisp clear quality images it will generate with different modes. Especially the portrait mode was excellent. Front and back camera both support 50 megapixels perfectly.  You can see the images too that i uploaded.Super macro mode, night mode, slow motion, etc are available. However zoom quality beyond 10X is not upto the mark and upto 50X zoom it shakes too much but to overcome this problem you can switch to high resolution mode which captures full details in brighter environment. Overall its. Great Camera phone...2. Screen (4.5) :- It's a quad curved display with 120Hz ulta smooth refresh rate which gives you very comfortable to scroll anything. Also screen brightness is good enough to use in sunlight as well. But one thing company didn't mentioned is screen protection. Yes weird but screen protection is not upto the mark. One should definitely use screen protector like UV Glass otherwise you might get scratches and other problems.3. Battery (5) :- 5200 mAh silicon carbon battery is too good to handle dialy work without any worry. Battery is well optimized and can last upto 2 days from normal to heavy usage.  Except one thing that  while taking photos it can consume more battery then using any other apps which is quite surprising. Also the Honor supercharger charge the phone from 0 to 100% within 45 to 50 minutes. But however the box does not contain any charger I bought it separately which cost me around 2.5k with an offer.4. Ai Features(5) :- In this segment Honor absolutely worked well than any other brands witb its MagisOs. i have shown an images of Honor Ai which comes with lots a needful features like Ai eraser, magic capsule, magic text, magic portal, Ai subtitles, Ai translate.These are very useful features which save time for example you can directly copy text from images, you can directly take cutout from any image just by tapping on it and can use it somewhere where you need it. And lot more. Thanks to AI5 Other Features (4.5) :- It has dual Nano sim which also supports dual esim feature. Dual stereo speakers which gives impressive sound.IR Blaster also available. Also 5g speed is good i use jio which didn't bother me at all. Along with these it has Multi window mode, Favourite space, Ai noice cancellation etc.6. Os Updates (4.7) :- since from i bought this phone i got continuous monthly updates with some new features everytime.** Major Concern is that they told after sale service is not good and also you cannot get parts for this phone if unluckily phone is damaged by any how. In my case i never went to after sale for any of my phone which (honor  or realme ) till now. And i hope in future also i won't go for that.Overall its Great phone to use which i bought at 22k in offer.Thanks amazon and Thanks to the Honor...👍👍"", 'Before uploading Android 16 it was good. But after update camera video recording output is very bad.Battery backup and other performance is good.', ""Been over a month.... Not at all disappointed with the price tag.

Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

I contacted Amazon customer support, followed by Motorola customer support, who confirmed that it is likely a hardware defect and advised me to visit the nearest service center for a replacement.However, upon visiting the Motorola service center, I was informed that they would only repair the device instead of providing a replacement. The repair process would take 5 to 7 days, which is completely unacceptable for a brand-new phone.

Sometimes the call gets cut automatically, sometimes you can't dial etc etc...you.have to keep tampering with the mobile data and wifi by turning them off or on and try various combinations before it works again. This again might seem like a small issue but hampers the experience a lot.3) Wifi and hotspot : You can't turn on the WiFi and the hotspot at the same time which might be a problem for some.

I didn't like the looks of this phone especially the big cameras, but I went for it as my budget was low this time.After 2 years of usage,Pros:*I don't think it ever hanged, and it's memory and storage both are more than enough for me. I have 160 apps, and I am too lazy to clear my phone's memory, text messages, photos, everything is intact.* Camera quality and sharpness good enough. (I don't know why I still like samsung cameras feel more)* My 1gb-3gb storage games don't hang here, they used to get jerky on my samsung.* Still charges superfast in 10 minutes. And it goes on for 1.5 to 2 days with more than6 hours of daily usage.* The cover I received with it for free, is silicone cover which is sturdy.* Touchscreen experience is smooth. (Samsung is a bit better)* Seems like Metallic body with glass protection on both sides.* Cheap and yet sturdy. Yet fast. Yet with all features you need and those you not need too.* On time android updates that samsung doesn't do.Cons:* It's heavy 184g and big, though slim. I like lightweight phones.* Auto brightness is still a feature with scope for improvement, thought it's better than my Samsung A8 star.* Only type-c or bluetooth earphones supported.* I wished there was lavender or peach color.* I prefer side sensor for fingerprint. Its in-display here."", ""This is my first one plus and brought with lots of expectation . In the box there it comes , Main Device, user manual, welcome letter, Red cable club card, One plus sticker, sim ejector pin, One free TPU same color case with one plus logo at the back and the 80watt charging adapter with red type c cable.  The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also déjà vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed -- The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part . You can now make wireless payment via Google pay from your credit card virtually . No need to carry card at wallet.- Samsung 6.7inch Amoled display with punch hole camera design and indisplay finger print sensor.- 5000 mah battery with 80 watt superVocc first charge . Battery draining rate is also very less at standard use . Makes full Charge in just 35 minutes.- Snapdragon processor is also capable of goog gaming without any frame drop and lag . The Ram is virtuality expandable upto extra 8GB- During gaming , its large vapor cooling chamber keeps the phone temperature optimal and shows allmost less heating issue. The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always déjà vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware .

The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞"", ""I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience."", ""Everything is on point as expected. But there are 1 or 2 things i want to share.1. Metal edges are little bit on sharp side so without cover it is difficult to use.2.

If you're thinking of trading in your old phone for a new one, especially online, be warned. It feels like the sellers and delivery agents really try to dodge those exchange deals. For three straight days, they'd show my phone 'out for delivery,' but it would never actually arrive. Then, poof, after 72 hours, it'd get sent back. Can you believe it? That's happened to me twice before!This time, thankfully, I managed to chat with the delivery guy, showed him my old phone (it was in perfect condition, by the way!), and he finally agreed to bring it over the next day. So yeah, my delivery experience? Pretty terrible, honestly. It was such a frustrating, anxious wait.Okay now about the Price and performance:I finally got my hands on the phone, especially for just ₹63,000(with exchange), which was a great deal. I'm totally in love with it! The features are just fantastic, seriously.Let's talk performance – it's just fantastic, no complaints at all there. This phone breezes through everything. I'm talking about super smooth multitasking, zipping through apps. I don't game so don't know about that.The Camera? Mind-Blowingly Amazing!The AI processing is mind-blowing. My photos and videos look stunning, even in tricky lighting. I'm still finding new hidden features in the camera app every single day, which is so cool!Now, the battery. Yeah, it could have been better, I'll admit. But honestly, the phone is so small and compact, I'm totally willing to overlook that. It's just so easy to hold and use! You still get good all-day power if you're not constantly glued to it. The build quality feels really premium too.I'm constantly finding little shortcuts and smart additions that just make using the phone so much better. It's really intuitive and super customizable. Like you can customise literally every look and feel.The Verdict:So, yeah, despite the nightmare getting it delivered, my Samsung S25 has truly blown me away. For ₹63,000(with exchange), it's an absolute steal. The top-notch performance, incredible camera, and its perfect compact size just make it a joy to use every single day. The battery could be better, sure, but honestly, everything else is just so good that I don't even care. I'm genuinely, truly in love with this phone! Couldn't be any better for me!"", ""Phone is good flawless. But the executive which came for pickup old phone deliberately saying phone quality has some issue.

Then he asked 2500 to fix the value. I was no where and have to accept his call. It's very bad. Every setup u will get these type of person. Amazon do something about these creature.Overall phone is flawless no issues after using a month. I love it it's handling"", ""So far, so good.

I got bored to android and wanted some change so switched to iPhone. Redmi phones otherwise are awesome too.😊Following are my experiences based on 8 days usage:- Battery backup is very good.Scenario 1:I got 3 days of backup with light usage(picking up the calls, replying whatsapp, 30 minutes of gameplay (genshin impact). For 1 and half days, my phone was on battery saver mode. For the rest of duration it was on normal mode.Scenario 2: Only on normal mode with moderate usage it gives 2 days of backup with light usage.- Performance is awesome. Everything is buttery smooth from apps to games.- Latest ios 17 is good as well. I didnt felt much problems while switching from android to iphone. Many things are improved.- You can remove most of the inbuilt apple apps with ios 17.Things i love about iPhone over android (redmi phones):- flawless performance especially for gaming. No android can offer this level of smoothness.- excellent and all rounder camera.- more battery backup compared to any androidThings i love about android over iPhone:- android is more flexible than ios. e.g you can’t select all emails in gmail app in iphone. You cant close all background running apps in one shot like we do it in android.- apps are way better in terms of usability.- i personally found that ios has more bugs than android ( which can be felt by a common user). E.g. keyboard sound suddenly increases, not able to receive a call sometimes. Apple do resolve these in their updates but for a phone which costs this much it’s embarrassing.- cheap cost compared to iphone. People usually go for iphone when they get bored from android (my case) or to be a status symbol or who needs reliable phone for long run. But the things have changed now. Even android offers long term support now and they are bit cheaper compared to iphone giving you more features and usability.Final verdict: iphone is allrounder phone in my opinion. Great camera, great performance, great battery life, great cost too😁. So if you need a change definitely go for it. Its a great phone.', ""Go for it.

Highly recommended!', ""I am writing this review after using the iPhone 16 Plus for three months. First, the box arrived in terrible condition, making me worried about the phone inside.  Thankfully, the phone itself was in perfect condition. Display: The display is very good, with nice viewing angles, but the Dynamic Island can be a little distracting when watching movies or other content.  The brightness is good, bright enough for outdoor use.Design: The design is great; it feels comfortable in hand, with nice curves around the edges. The matte finish on the back prevents fingerprints.  It also doesn't feel too heavy.Camera: The camera is good. Daylight photos are sharp with natural colors, but when zoomed in, the details aren't as good as other phones in the same price range.  While other phones retain some detail when zoomed, the 16 Plus's images look blurry. However, it has nice features like Photographic Styles and Audio Mix, which are very useful.  iPhones are known for their video quality, and the 16 Plus doesn't disappoint. Videos are excellent, with top-notch quality, great detail, dynamic range, and natural-looking colors. Portraits also look very good.Battery: The battery life is fantastic. I previously used a OnePlus 8, which had terrible battery life, barely lasting four hours.  The 16 Plus is a huge improvement. As a heavy user, I'm very satisfied. With moderate use, the battery lasts me until the next day. With heavy use (gaming, movies, YouTube), I need to charge it at night. The only disappointment with iPhones is the charging speed, which feels slow compared to Android phones. Fast charging only goes up to 45 watts, especially when playing games or doing other demanding tasks while charging.Performance: Performance is top-notch. The A18 chip is very powerful and handles heavy tasks easily. I experienced no lags or frame drops while gaming.Software: iOS 18 is very good in terms of customization. Apple has finally added features that have been available on Android for years, like app lock and the ability to hide apps. However, Apple's AI features aren't that impressive or exciting. While the Siri integration with ChatGPT is good and useful, and the writing tools are helpful, I feel Apple should introduce more AI features, like Samsung, which are more useful and exciting.Overall, I feel the iPhone 16 Plus is great for daily use. It has very good performance, great battery life, and good cameras. Its shortcomings are the lack of a ProMotion 120Hz display. Apple should have at least provided 90Hz for a phone costing 90K and the absence of a telephoto camera. For first-time iPhone buyers, the 16 Plus is a great choice, but for those looking to upgrade, it might not be worth it right now."", 'Amazing product....Will update after few months of use', 'I recently upgraded to the iPhone 16 plus, and I’m absolutely thrilled with it!

The new screen technology makes everything look vibrant and sharp, even under direct sunlight.Camera: The camera system is fantastic. The improved low-light performance and new image stabilization features have allowed me to capture stunning, professional-quality photos.The high-resolution front camera is perfect for video calls and selfies. Apple has clearly focused on making the iPhone 16 plus a go-to device for photography enthusiasts.Battery Life: Battery life has improved significantly. I can easily go a full day on a single charge with moderate use, and the fast-charging feature is a life-saver when I’m in a rush.Performance: Powered by Apple’s latest chipset, the iPhone 16 plus is incredibly fast and responsive. Whether I’m multitasking between apps or playing graphics-heavy games, it never lags. The new iOS version runs flawlessly, offering a smooth, intuitive user experience.New Features: I especially appreciate the enhanced Face ID technology, which works faster and more accurately. The new AI features in the Photos app are a fun addition, making it easier to sort and edit my images.Overall, the iPhone 16 plus is worth every penny.

This review shall not be too much technical babble and I shall highlight through pros and cons as during the use of this Realme GT 6T phone.Pros:1. Excellent battery backup.2. Excellent display. The phone may never need the full brightness even in sunlight.3. Both the 120 hz display and the lower refresh rate display mode are fluidic.4. Excellent cameras both front or back. I have posted few shots with different shooting conditions. The night photographs are specially good for this price range. You can notice the pixelations of night photos if you zoom in to the highest point and that is a minimum concern for me. The indoor light conditions also give great photos in xdr and normal mode too. The video capture is also great. The 4k 60 fps gives great video shots and there is OIS too. There is also a street mode shot in the camera. The portraits are also good and edge detection is great.5. Almost no overheating unless you are sharing data over hotspot or playing games for a long time.6. I play Asphalt United and it is playing smooth in performance setting of the game.7. Both the fingerprint and the face sensors are quick.8. The sound is very good. The phone has two speakers for that. It does not have that over amplifying customisation nowadays provided in Oppo Reno where the sound quality is compromised.9. The UI is a replica of Oppo phone's UI. I also have a Oppo Reno 8T and things are exactly same. FYI, Realme phones are manufactured by Oppo.10. The customisation in sound can be done where spatial sound and holo projection can be used while listening music or watching movies.11. There is a inbuilt AI removal tool given for editing of photos which works well.12. The phone has IP65 rating. However, nowhere in the phone this information is given. I had to corroborate from the official site of Realme India.13. The speakers and microphone are good and clarity of voice calls are good provided good network strength is there. For internet voice calls, the voice are excellent and crisp.14. It comes with a mammoth 120 watt adapter which some reviewers say that it can be used as a laptop charger too. However, I personally don't endorse that. I charge with an existing Oppo 90 watt charger and it does fine fast charging.15. Great thing Realme decided to do away with bloatwares. There are a few pre-installed pre-loaded Realme apps which can be either uninstalled or disabled. There are no ads in the settings yet.Cons:1. The UI could have been a bit different. However, this is my opinion because I have been using an Oppo phone too. For those who are using this UI as a new one, the UI is good.2. The biggest disappointment for this phone to me is the back of this phone. It is not metal. However, disappointment is not due to that, it is for the design. Even if the camera setup and the general design is minimalist the use of the flat mirror like panel actually kills the look of the phone. It is too fingerprint prone. The back cover that comes with the package actually is a cut out design that exposes that mirror like panel and with use it attracts and shows too many fingerprint smudges and dirt.However, in one word if I may say is that Realme GT 6T is a beast in this price range and can be bought even with eyes closed."", ""This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me.Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent)Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous)Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments)Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor)OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps)Finger print scanner: 5/5So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective.Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍.WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful.What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there.Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective.Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!"", 'Display - 10/10Rear Camera - 7/10UW camera - 7/10Front camera - 6.5/10Overall photos - 7/10Overall videos - 7/10Network reception - 6/10Speakers - 7/10Microphones - 8/10IR blaster - 10/10Battery - 7/10Battery life - 6/10Processor - 8/10Haptics - 8/10USB port - 7/10Charging speed - 10/10Looks - 7/10Performance - 8/10Thermals - 6/10Durability - 10/10 (dropped on lots of surfaces by mistake without a screen guard...and had a lot of water exposures too.. no problems)Buttons - 6/10', ""The media could not be loaded.Genuine Review After 9 Months of Use:The Realme GT 6T is a powerful and superb smartphone.

Even after 9 months, it's running smooth, fast, and cool with no issues.

And I am absolutely loving it! If you are trying to decide if it is a good phone, it definitely is. OnePlus is offering a 7k exchange bonus till Jan-end, so you can toss away any old working or non-working phone to get a decent discount. With the exchange and Republic Day offers, I got it for around 60K which I feel is a steal. I got the Midnight Ocean variant especially for the textured blue back and it does feel premium.I preferred OP13 over the awesome Samsung S23 ultra mainly because Samsung is not extending the OS updates promise like it did for S24 ultra. Being released this year, OP13 should get at least 4 years of OS updates.DISPLAYThe ProXDR QXD+ LTPO AMOLED display is amazing as expected. In direct sunlight you may need to increase the brightness to near full. The 120Hz refresh rate gives flicker-free screen transitions. Color reproduction is great too. I keep the Always-On display mode that I fell in love with on my previous Pixel. The edge-to-edge display with mildly bent edges and corners offers a lot of real estate. It's a relatively big phone but is not that heavy and can comfortably fit a men's jeans pocket.HARDWAREThe Snapdragon Elite is really snappy! No issues running anything or even many things. I am not a gamer, but have not experienced any heating issues so far. Apart from the 16GB RAM, it adds another virtual 12GB RAM making it a whopping 30GB RAM beast. The half a TB of RAM is almost fully available for shooting hi-res videos or loading big games as the OS and apps occupy less than 50GB of space. It comes with two nano SIM slots. Of course  it supports eSIMs too, but guess you can have only upto two active at a time. Apart from the usual sensors that are standard in most phones nowadays, it comes with a Color temperature sensor, Compass, Ultrasonic fingerprint, Hall sensor, Laser focus sensor, Spectral sensors and Infrared remote control. It also supports the latest standards in most areas - Bluetooth 5.4, WiFi 7, NFC and all GPS systems including NavIC. There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more.

The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more.

Plus Steam seems to have a much wider range of much more competitive VR games in their library for very reasonable prices and absolute steal deals during Steam Sales.A- If you want to play through your pc wireless, you'll need to install Meta Quest link app and Steam VR on your pc. With these and your Quest 3 connected to Wifi, you can render the game on your pc, have it stream start to your headset. For best experience I upgraded to a Wifi 6 router, 5Ghz bandwidth support.B- If you want to play wired, it'll be great if can arrange a high quality ctype to ctype link cable and your pc supports ctype input then that's even better.The device has a run time of almost 2hrs in one charging based on what's your headset resolution, refresh rate and other settings.I've noticed if you're playing through your pc and let the audio come from your pc instead of inbuilt speakers in headset, you can save up on battery charge that goes in providing sound output otherwise.The games I've played on Quest 3 through Steam:1- Beat Saber - Great game, extremely high replay value, great physical activity substitute.2- Pistol Whip - Same as beat saber but you feel like John Wick!3- Bonelab/Boneworks - Fun physics sandbox and shooting4- I expect you to die - Comedic puzzle solving5- Hitman World of Assassination - The latest Hitman Trilogy but in VR, definitely worth experiencing6- Phasmophobia VR - Co-op Ghost Hunting in VR, so so much fun, absolutely must try!In my collective experience, the device functionality has been really great, battery life could be better and in terms of the type of games you can expect and should go for -While it's fun to think of playing a slowburn unfolding openworld like Skyrim or a similar game, you might find yourself realising that more faster paced games like Pistol Whip and Beat Saber feel the best experienced on this medium, any game that is slow, takes time, takes exploration and less action might make you feel bored and tired faster than the prior example as games like Pistol Whip and all are asking to HIIT workout and keep you on your toes and keeps pumping you with dopamine hits as you move your body around to hit the targets. In more exploration heavy games you might feel tired because body movement is less and with less physical movement the weight of the device hanging in front of your eyes and the feeling of feet ache since you've mostly been standing still not moving much will overcome the eagerness to explore the game quite fast.This might differ from person to person.But all in all, great device for playing games, I really hope they reiterate and improve its battery life further."", 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Working great, must have for puzzle gaming fans.

Arrived in very safe packaging with no crack or dent on the box from Delhivery. 👍🏻Opening up the box carefully gives you all the things mentioned in the product. Started it off just like the tutorials mentioned, completed the profile setup and the rest of the settings configurations.Pros:I've tried almost everything it can do to this point with it, when it comes to generic work/ productivity, entertainment, games etc.The product is remarkable for what it can do. The performance is top-notch, no log whatsoever anywhere, visuals are stunning in the apps and movies. Connectivity with bluetooth and controllers is seamless. Pixel spreading is done fantastically on the pancake lenses. Everything is quite sharp as well. It gives you dozens of settings as well to configure the product according to your liking.Many visual experiences will leave you in awe. Batman: Arkham Shadow and Asgard's Wrath: 2 being the most powerful examples of he point. The sound via the built-in speakers is very immersive as well. UI is quite well built and is easy to access everything but there's a lot of improvement required to make it customisable although the Spatial app makes the UI just like Apple Vision Pro but at a cost. More updates will hopefully fullfill these requirements.Cons:It is so much fun to play around/ work and watch multimedia in it that you feel like the 2 hr battery run time isn't even close to enough. So I would recommend everyone to get a power bank with similar Ampere and Wattage attached to it to extend your juice.Connectivity of it with PC wirelessly to use your PC in the headset still lags even with the v69 update with my laptop. But I'm sure the link cable, which I haven't tested yet, will solve this problem for PCVR games and general multitasking work.Most of the fun and useful apps in the Meta Store are still paid and some are paid even if you activate your 3-month Meta Quest+ trial.None of the above are the cons of the product itself.Conclusion: The product and my experience with it has been fantastic and still there is much to explore.

It was a big leap forward for me.— TRACKING —Gone are the days when you had to have fixed sensors in your room with a fixed play area. Now, you can bring this anywhere and play wirelessly, with or without a computer. Just the fact that I don't need sensors is a win. The tech packed into this can detect your surrounding environments quickly and easily. It even tracks your hands and you can navigate with just your hands using gestures similar to an iPad/iPhone.— SCREEN —The screen is a big improvement over previous generations, including Meta's Pro model. The colors are vibrant, the sharpness is perfect, and getting your head in the sweet spot is much easier. I advise using an app to measure your eye distance (like Eye Measure), and then you can adjust the lenses to suit your exact eye distance for optimum viewing comfort.— STORAGE —I got the 512GB because I was torn about their pricing model. I didn't want to underdo it so I spent the extra money so I had more space, even if I didn't know if I would need it. Frankly, 256GB would've been perfect for me personally at the moment.— WIRELESS PLAY —The games runs off the headset—if you buy games from the Meta Quest store. They do run more expensive and the sales are okay when they're there. If you have been buying VR games on Steam, you can run them wirelessly with SteamVR as long as your computer's graphics card is compatible. You can also physically connect a USB-C cable to a computer to play your games.— GAMES —Games feel like an elevated Nintendo 64 at the moment. The tech is there, we just need higher-quality textures and more AAA games when the masses start pouring in. Most games seem to have a stylized polygonal quality to them, and few games are going for a realistic look. Currently, I would say the quality of games is good enough for where the technology is at the moment in terms of the processing power that's in the headset at this price point.One of the great things is Asgard's Wrath II is included free with purchase and this is one of those games that takes full advantage of this headset's capabilities. You also get a 6-month free trial of Quest+, which is two pre-selected curated games per month for as long as you're a member; you lose those games when you cancel, but if you subscribe again your library will be there.— APPS —Besides games, you can use different apps with this. I use Virtual Desktop to access my 3D movie files on my computer, plus other media I have. I can also access my SteamVR games this way as well. Then there are media consumption apps like Amazon and Netflix. Explore and you'll find useful things to install.— MIXED REALITY —This is part of the future of gaming, baby. Having a big play space at home combined with a mixed reality game is one of the most fun experiences to have. This is also similar tech in Apple's Vision Pro. There are a couple of free games included, and I can't wait to see what the future holds in this growing game category.— BATTERY —The battery lasts on average about two hours. For me, that's great because I generally get a little dizzy before that period so the headset will die before I get fully nauseous. VR dizziness is a real thing and I advise that if you start feeling some type of way, to stop sooner rather than later. I would build up your brain's tolerance to VR slowly. If you get dizzy, start timing how long it takes. Take a day off and try to add 10 minutes or so in the next session, until you can go longer.If you are one of the lucky few who are not affected by dizziness, you can plug this into a wall while playing and it will charge while you play. In theory, you could play non-stop with the right cable and charger.— SUMMARY —If you haven't gotten into VR yet, try it out in the stores. If you like it, then definitely get the Meta Quest 3. If you're unsure, you could wait for a price drop hopefully around Christmas of 2024."", ""It doesn't have 6 months free trial, also it doesn't come with asgard's wrath 2, so false advertisment...""]",General Satisfaction & Overall Experience,0.1793857142857142,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nkctF66PL._SX679_.jpg

Super happy with the purchase!', ""Well some reviews about this device were too harsh so I was a bit confused whether to buy it or not . I was initially using a Realme GT Master Edition so  switching from my old phone was very smooth . I will go by department by department ratings of this phone .1. Processor 10/10 : Quite fast at this price point(9400e) , though IQOO Neo 10 is already giving almost that(8s Gen4) at a lower price . For 99% tasks , you won't even need this much amount of processor perf but may help in intensive gaming sessions .2. Battery and Charging 9.5/10 : Battery life is actually very good . A moderate usage will last for around 1.5 days . Charging is also seriously fast , though it will definitely reduce the effective battery capacity in future . Also it is a first gen silicon-carbon battery so maybe there are potential risks as well in future . (You can think of OP 13R since it has Li-ion battery)3. Camera 8/10 : Decent camera , 2x telephoto lens is disappointing in this price point (ik this is kinda gaming focused) . But it clicks good enough pics from primary lens . Camera is not it's USP I'm telling you .4. Software  8.5/10 : It shares the same codebase with Oppo's ColorOS and OnePlus's OxygenOS , so most of the features are common . But just like OnePlus did more overhaul over the base ColorOS , Realme didn't do any such brand specific optimizations . But software is better than FuntouchOS found in Vivo/IQOO devices (I have used them as well) but definitely ranks below OneUI . Animations are fast and customizable as well .5. Other features : LPDDR5X ram works fantastic and UFS 4.0 storage is pretty fast . It has an IR BLASTER which is handy in many cases . Speakers are loud enough . Display is gorgeous as usual in this price range but not sure about the 6000 nits peak brightness maybe a marketing gimmick . Otherwise HBM is good , visible under sunlight , also has an option for Extra brightness in the settings that draws more power.*** P.S. In my unit , I didn't face any heating issues except a little  bit during charging (normal for 120W).  For small gaming sessions like 30-40 mins , it easily handled COD at full graphics settings without noticeable heating . Just after buying this , I got two small software updates in two days .*** May write a long term future review as well"", 'Badiya phone hai, bohot features hai, camera me video shooting ka toh koi competition nahi hai is range me aur photography mein thoda lack karta hai, bgmi gameplay ekdum smooth hai, battery backup thoda kam laga, charging bhi jaldi ho jati hai, iqoo 10 aur poco f7 bhi range par un phone me jo nahi hai vo isme mil jayega, iqoo 10 me ip69 rating nahi hai aur poco ka camera aur heating issue hai par bhai gt7 me sab mil jayega', ""It's a awesome phone I must say....when I have decided to buy a phone with good camera... everyone suggested me to buys samsung or i phone...but as I am realme lover...i have decided to buy this phone...and yes it was very good decision... excellent camera in this price range I must say....i didn't find any heating issue as off now...it's been one month I am using this phone...❣️❣️❣️❣️"", ""Using realme gt7for more than a weak and here is the complete reviewGt 7is Good in terms of display and offers excellent battery very good for gamers I didn't observe any heating issue but yes slightly gets warm if used outside while video recording or prolonged usage but it is not noticeable.battery easily lasts a day for a verage user.

I got it for 35k using a different seller than the one proposed by the algorithm. I wanted a 1 day delivery as opposed to the standard one proposed by ""Prime"". Watch has most of the features mentioned by users above/below however here\'s the reason for 3 stars:1. Galaxy Wearable App - 0/5. Samsung doesn\'t have a proper and stable App. It has bluetooth issues and needs the watch to be reset everytime, this wiping away all your excercise and health records (you need to back it up everytime which is ridiculous)2. The One UI is based on the Wear OS which means that none of the Apps are truly controlled by Samsung and hence you have to install multiple Apps - Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, Samsung Switch and many more for those specific features. The dependency on Google Wear OS is problematic.3. Apparently it says Airtel doesn\'t have mobile plans so ""Cellular"" mode cannot be used. This literally reduces the watch to a Non-LTE variant4. ECG and Cardio related tracking can be done only by tethering with a Samsung Phone. This is not on any of the product reviews so this is a BIG disappointment as the whole idea of an Android ecosystem is to make it inter-oprable.5. Amazon return policy makes it impossible to return/replace the watch even on same day as delivery, you have to risk going to samsung service for any blips and hence the whole product user experience is annoying6. Charging : For average user who doesn\'t keep bluetooth/wifi on whole day and with minimum workout also the watch needs a charge every 1.5 to 2 days.7. Dial is big, very bulky and heavy, not advisable for womenPositives:1. Watch quality is good, titanium body and strap clips2. Sleep and good User Interface within the watch3. Has few good watch face options on galaxy Wearable App4. Can access play store and install compatible apps5. Sync well with Samsung Health App for basic tracking for non-Samsung Phone users6. Most other watch capabilities are available so not mentioning those.Conclusion:If you have a Samsung Phone you can go for it without any hassle. For non-Samsung Phone users there can be multiple challenges along the way including loss of precious health data. Given second chance I\'d probably go for a similar FitBit variant and not risk Samsung as they are dependent on Google for OS and other App updates.']",General Satisfaction & Overall Experience,0.6583333333333333,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81i1Vn-KQuL._SX679_.jpg

And I am absolutely loving it! If you are trying to decide if it is a good phone, it definitely is. OnePlus is offering a 7k exchange bonus till Jan-end, so you can toss away any old working or non-working phone to get a decent discount. With the exchange and Republic Day offers, I got it for around 60K which I feel is a steal. I got the Midnight Ocean variant especially for the textured blue back and it does feel premium.I preferred OP13 over the awesome Samsung S23 ultra mainly because Samsung is not extending the OS updates promise like it did for S24 ultra. Being released this year, OP13 should get at least 4 years of OS updates.DISPLAYThe ProXDR QXD+ LTPO AMOLED display is amazing as expected. In direct sunlight you may need to increase the brightness to near full. The 120Hz refresh rate gives flicker-free screen transitions. Color reproduction is great too. I keep the Always-On display mode that I fell in love with on my previous Pixel. The edge-to-edge display with mildly bent edges and corners offers a lot of real estate. It's a relatively big phone but is not that heavy and can comfortably fit a men's jeans pocket.HARDWAREThe Snapdragon Elite is really snappy! No issues running anything or even many things. I am not a gamer, but have not experienced any heating issues so far. Apart from the 16GB RAM, it adds another virtual 12GB RAM making it a whopping 30GB RAM beast. The half a TB of RAM is almost fully available for shooting hi-res videos or loading big games as the OS and apps occupy less than 50GB of space. It comes with two nano SIM slots. Of course  it supports eSIMs too, but guess you can have only upto two active at a time. Apart from the usual sensors that are standard in most phones nowadays, it comes with a Color temperature sensor, Compass, Ultrasonic fingerprint, Hall sensor, Laser focus sensor, Spectral sensors and Infrared remote control. It also supports the latest standards in most areas - Bluetooth 5.4, WiFi 7, NFC and all GPS systems including NavIC. There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more. Hope the review was helpful."", 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Great features at a fairly reasonable cost.Functionality:Top notch !

Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

I got bored to android and wanted some change so switched to iPhone. Redmi phones otherwise are awesome too.😊Following are my experiences based on 8 days usage:- Battery backup is very good.Scenario 1:I got 3 days of backup with light usage(picking up the calls, replying whatsapp, 30 minutes of gameplay (genshin impact). For 1 and half days, my phone was on battery saver mode. For the rest of duration it was on normal mode.Scenario 2: Only on normal mode with moderate usage it gives 2 days of backup with light usage.- Performance is awesome. Everything is buttery smooth from apps to games.- Latest ios 17 is good as well. I didnt felt much problems while switching from android to iphone. Many things are improved.- You can remove most of the inbuilt apple apps with ios 17.Things i love about iPhone over android (redmi phones):- flawless performance especially for gaming. No android can offer this level of smoothness.- excellent and all rounder camera.- more battery backup compared to any androidThings i love about android over iPhone:- android is more flexible than ios. e.g you can’t select all emails in gmail app in iphone. You cant close all background running apps in one shot like we do it in android.- apps are way better in terms of usability.- i personally found that ios has more bugs than android ( which can be felt by a common user). E.g. keyboard sound suddenly increases, not able to receive a call sometimes. Apple do resolve these in their updates but for a phone which costs this much it’s embarrassing.- cheap cost compared to iphone. People usually go for iphone when they get bored from android (my case) or to be a status symbol or who needs reliable phone for long run. But the things have changed now. Even android offers long term support now and they are bit cheaper compared to iphone giving you more features and usability.Final verdict: iphone is allrounder phone in my opinion. Great camera, great performance, great battery life, great cost too😁. So if you need a change definitely go for it. Its a great phone.', ""Go for it.

Wished they provided usb c to headphone jack adaptor too for some of the older folks how like to use wired headphones.First thing when I held the device was how light it felt in hand. Comparing with Nothing Phone 2 and S22 Ultra it felt super handy and light weight.Design wise, I liked it very much. Simple yet elegant looks, very comfortable in using also. Camera island is the highlight of the device and looks evident that IQOO team had given a lot of thought in designing. Having a boxy design helps in grip. Device sits nicely in hand and feels like a solid device. Still I would suggest a good case for better grip and protection. I ordered white colour and it looks just beautiful. BMW lines are now replaced with BMW stripe logo which gives an elegant and rich looks to the device. Side buttons are nicely positioned and are tactile and clicky.Display, in one word it's awesome. I have used a lot flagships and can say it's not at all inferior. It's a puch hole display and punch hole is moderately large in size. If it could been smaller in size it would have been brilliant. Brightness is very good and it's easily visible evev in bright sun. Colours look rich. Not a technical expert but can say display looks pleasent and wonderful. It's 1.5k display and looks quite sharp. You won't miss 2k much, to be honest I feel fhd+ is more then enough for mobile displays. Along with brightness, display can go ultra dim too. Turn on extra dim option from quick setting toggle to lower brightness even further if required.Processor wise, it have latest and fastest snapdragon processor, SD 8 Gen 3. Thanks to the processor device is extremely smooth and lag free. Scrolling, switching apps, multitasking, gaming all are quite fast and one can feel the difference if coming from 2 generation old flagship device or any mid range device.Regular usage doesn't heat up device at all. I was using S22 Ultra before this and it regularly got hot even in day to day tasks. But  IQOO 12 didn't heat up like that. In a week of usage of my handset never experienced any heating issues or hangups in device.Software wise, it's quite a good experience compared to older version of OS. As the IQOO team promised no hot app or hot games, it's not completely true. Once you open Vivo store app all the apps pop up but this time they can be removed. Few bloatware and duplicate apps are present too. But after removing bloatwares and disabling or muting notifications of apps you don't require experience gets pretty good.UI looks have been revamped and now it looks modern. IQOO/Vivo now needs to revamp their home launcher app. It lacks a lot of features like hidding apps, secure folder to name a few. Installing third party home launcher solves these issues but many widgets become unusable like weather, album etc. Dynamic effects also gets disabled on third party launcher which is a bummer.Battery life is quite good. Light usage can give you 2 days battery life easily. Moderate usage leaves you with 40% to 50% battery at the end of the day and heavy usage should leave you with 10% to 20% easily.Overall SoT on moderate usage which I got was around 8 hrs to 9 hrs. Charging is super fast with in the box 120w charger. Phone gets fully charged in less then half an hour. If they would have given wireless charging support too, it would have been great. But not much to miss though.All the required sensors are present like nfc, gyro, accelerometer and all works fine. No issues in proximity sensor also. Speakers are good not the best but much better then average.Using on 5G jio in Hyderabad, great reception and signal strength. No heating also even on 5G network (Moto edge 40 had this issue).Haptics are also very good not Apple level but very good still. Implemented very nicely and can be felt in all the places like typing, general scrolling etc.I am surprised why IQOO team chose to give usb 2.0 port for data transfer. I usually transfer files from mobile to pc and vice versa regularly. Having restricted speed means a lot of time for transfer. I didn't thought of it as a deal breaker but after usage I can say it is a deal breaker.Camera section is something where I don't have much experience. I don't use camera much. But whatever pics I have clicked gave very good results. For most it should be more then enough. For professional analysis look elsewhere. Daylight and night time shots boty came out pretty good for me. I am just point and click type of shooter😅.All in all I can easily recommend this device to any person who want a super fast device with stable os experience. Every thing in the device are functional and very thoughtfully designed device.Only major drawback is usb 2.0 port for data transfer and missing wireless charging. Slight more polishing in software section can improve the user experience even further."", ""Such an amazing phone even in 2025. I'm a heavy user and a heavy camera user so I wanted to go for Flagship at the same time at low price then I found this gem 💎 it is amazing. Go for it. To me personally iQOO 13 is a downgrade from iQOO 12 except the chip. So if you are looking for Flagship phone under 50 it is your choice. I also had oneplus 12 as an option but I don't like Curved display it is the only reason for me to not choosing it. If you are ok with curved display you can absolutely go for that too.Charging speed:AmazingFingerprint sensor:FastGaming capability:RocketLooks:Stunningly PremiumUser friendly:I like everything except this Funtouch Os 🙃"", ""The media could not be loaded.It's been 5m since I bought this phone had a great experience, switched from iqoo neo 6 and this upgrade is worth it if you want best performance and overall good camera, the photos are really good as it's vivo's sub brand so the image pipeline is really good just vibrant on some occasions but you will not be disappointed. And the video quality is the one which surprised me the most it's actually really not iPhone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 ISO AND EVERYTHING AUTO, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. Battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours I play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. Battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. Charging takes 35 min to full charge. I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade. ( I hope vivo and iqoo bring custom rom support because that would be great to have like poco and oneplus ).Pros* Good camera for the price could be bit better in video.* One of the best gaming phones does heat up but in a controlled way and cools down pretty fast.* Really Fast charging speed ( does heat a bit nothing to bother or just open settings - battery - charging and disable fast charging it will slightly slow down charging speed but it will decrease phone's surface temp ).* Good display very bright overall really goodscreen.* Very good after sale service ( disclaimer had experience with previous phone iqoo Neo 6 regarding screen replacement bit pricey but really good experience and very fast.Cons* Mediocre Selfie camera my old IQoo Neo 6 had better selfie's than this paid 55k for a phone and no 4k Selfie video front is the biggest downside of this phone.* UI is good very reliable but not as good as other Android Skins ( Just updated to android 15 did make a way better and smoother but could be better).* And audio transmitter has kinda bad the output is not upto to the mark with bluetooh specifically had same problem with my Neo 6 my poco f1 had really good audio Dec on board than this two new phones.Overall - 4.4/5This is rating is based on my experience, and also to point out I'm very heavy user, so the fact that it is able to keep up with demands is actually very commendable, And a brief disclaimer I am a long term iqoo user been using iqoo brand since 2022 but overall the phone is really good and has impressed me. That's the reason I'm taking my time and giving a review here.Quick updateAnd BTW regarding updating your phone I still stand by NOT UPDATING YOUR PHONE, but I have updated to android 15 I did reasearch thoroughly and decided update because there were a lot improvement and I don't plan on updating after this update ( So the phone is on android 15 Nov security patch )."", 'Performance next level,  Camera quality, first charging ,', 'Hello.

Here's an overview of its highlights and areas where it falls short:### **Positives**1. **Stunning Display**: The 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is a visual treat with vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It performs exceptionally well even under direct sunlight.2. **Solid Build Quality**: With an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the phone feels sturdy yet premium. It's also IP68-certified for water and dust resistance.3. **Top-notch Performance**: Powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, the S24+ delivers seamless multitasking and gaming experiences. Apps load quickly, and heavy games run without any noticeable lag.4. **Impressive Camera System**: The triple-camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Photos are sharp, well-detailed, and dynamic, even in low-light conditions. The AI enhancements add a professional touch to your pictures.5. **Battery Life**: The 4900mAh battery easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use, and the 45W fast charging ensures you’re back in action quickly.6. **Software Experience**: One UI 6.1 is polished and intuitive, offering a plethora of customization options and thoughtful features like DeX mode for productivity enthusiasts.### **Negatives**1. **Price Point**: At its premium price, the S24+ competes with other flagship devices that offer similar or slightly better features, making it a tough sell for budget-conscious users.2. **Limited Optical Zoom**: The 3x optical zoom feels underwhelming compared to competitors like the Google Pixel 8 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro, which offer higher zoom capabilities.3. **No MicroSD Slot**: Samsung has once again omitted the microSD card slot, which might disappoint users who rely on expandable storage.4. **Bloatware**: Despite being a flagship, the S24+ comes pre-installed with unnecessary apps that detract from the otherwise premium experience.5. **Charging Brick Not Included**: Following industry trends, Samsung does not include a charging brick in the box, which can be inconvenient for those without a compatible charger.The Samsung Galaxy S24+ is a fantastic all-rounder that excels in design, performance, and camera capabilities. While it has a few shortcomings, they are relatively minor compared to its overall excellence. If you're looking for a reliable flagship phone and are willing to overlook the absence of a few features, the Galaxy S24+ is worth considering."", ""It's decent but suffers from some overall slowness and lag after launching apps, mild freezes sometimes, and slowness while sending youtube, facebook, insta links on whatsapp take long to show up. Other apps also render very slowly. Not sure if this is a Samsung One UI issue but this happens with almost every apps and it's Allah more noticeable as I switched over from IPhone XS."", ""After using it for two months,  excellent phone. Camera quality good. Front camera bit ok. Rear camera awesome. Weight not much , doesn't feel heavy without cover. Absolute worthy for money. Design good."", ""I bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time I was quite scared that the same thing will happen again. And sadly, my fears were right. The first thing I did was compare internet speed with my other phone and the speed was less than half of what was in other phone. These two times can't be a coincidence. I tried everything to accont for any error. I even exchanged the SIMs even though both were Jio, so that I am 100% sure.There is definitely some problem with exynos processor and internet speeds but I didn't know the drop would be less than half of what others are giving.Also there are genuine heating issues. Even for day to day task it would heat up. I knew about heating issues in Exynos but thought it was a premium flagship phone and my usage is quite light so it wouldn't make a difference. But, it did make a difference. Even on a 5-10 minues call it would heat up and become uncomfortable.Really feel cheated out of my money this time. I guess there is a reason they don't sell exynos in USA and China. Also there is  reason there was no exynos in S23 series and neither it is in S25.Once you buy the product can only be replaced and not returned, so you will be stuck with a smartphone where the most basic and the most critical function of a stable and fast internet itself is not there. Plus heating issues even on basic tasks will lead to throttling and slowing down ruining your experience.It is definitely not worth the money even on a huge discount which would be coming as I don't think otherwise anybody would buy it.The whole purpose of me writing this review (I generally don't review products) is to feel at least some sense of comfort that somebody else may not lose his/her money like I did, reading my review.If you want Samsung only - go for S23 series or S25 or S24 ultra but at all cost avoid Exynos processor. They are definitely, with multiple, and over the years, empirical evidence have significantly (not just slightly) poor and unstable internet speeds and really bad heating problems and it doesn't matter what is the pattern of your usage and these reviewers on youtube dont' tell us that.My Speed Test Data: On Snapdragon with Jio5G - Upto 140, always 100 Mbps + ; On Exynos with same SIM - Max 30-40 and on average 20-30, but the catch it is very unstable so a lot of time below 10 and even below 1.AVOID EXYNOS.

The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white!

You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes.

I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

Highly recommended!', ""I am writing this review after using the iPhone 16 Plus for three months. First, the box arrived in terrible condition, making me worried about the phone inside.  Thankfully, the phone itself was in perfect condition. Display: The display is very good, with nice viewing angles, but the Dynamic Island can be a little distracting when watching movies or other content.  The brightness is good, bright enough for outdoor use.Design: The design is great; it feels comfortable in hand, with nice curves around the edges. The matte finish on the back prevents fingerprints.  It also doesn't feel too heavy.Camera: The camera is good. Daylight photos are sharp with natural colors, but when zoomed in, the details aren't as good as other phones in the same price range.  While other phones retain some detail when zoomed, the 16 Plus's images look blurry. However, it has nice features like Photographic Styles and Audio Mix, which are very useful.  iPhones are known for their video quality, and the 16 Plus doesn't disappoint. Videos are excellent, with top-notch quality, great detail, dynamic range, and natural-looking colors. Portraits also look very good.Battery: The battery life is fantastic. I previously used a OnePlus 8, which had terrible battery life, barely lasting four hours.  The 16 Plus is a huge improvement. As a heavy user, I'm very satisfied. With moderate use, the battery lasts me until the next day. With heavy use (gaming, movies, YouTube), I need to charge it at night. The only disappointment with iPhones is the charging speed, which feels slow compared to Android phones. Fast charging only goes up to 45 watts, especially when playing games or doing other demanding tasks while charging.Performance: Performance is top-notch. The A18 chip is very powerful and handles heavy tasks easily. I experienced no lags or frame drops while gaming.Software: iOS 18 is very good in terms of customization. Apple has finally added features that have been available on Android for years, like app lock and the ability to hide apps. However, Apple's AI features aren't that impressive or exciting. While the Siri integration with ChatGPT is good and useful, and the writing tools are helpful, I feel Apple should introduce more AI features, like Samsung, which are more useful and exciting.Overall, I feel the iPhone 16 Plus is great for daily use. It has very good performance, great battery life, and good cameras. Its shortcomings are the lack of a ProMotion 120Hz display. Apple should have at least provided 90Hz for a phone costing 90K and the absence of a telephoto camera. For first-time iPhone buyers, the 16 Plus is a great choice, but for those looking to upgrade, it might not be worth it right now."", 'Amazing product....Will update after few months of use', 'I recently upgraded to the iPhone 16 plus, and I’m absolutely thrilled with it! Apple has really outdone itself with this model, bringing several new features that make a noticeable difference in daily use.Design and Display: The design is sleek and modern, with an edge-to-edge display that feels immersive. The new screen technology makes everything look vibrant and sharp, even under direct sunlight.Camera: The camera system is fantastic. The improved low-light performance and new image stabilization features have allowed me to capture stunning, professional-quality photos.The high-resolution front camera is perfect for video calls and selfies. Apple has clearly focused on making the iPhone 16 plus a go-to device for photography enthusiasts.Battery Life: Battery life has improved significantly. I can easily go a full day on a single charge with moderate use, and the fast-charging feature is a life-saver when I’m in a rush.Performance: Powered by Apple’s latest chipset, the iPhone 16 plus is incredibly fast and responsive. Whether I’m multitasking between apps or playing graphics-heavy games, it never lags. The new iOS version runs flawlessly, offering a smooth, intuitive user experience.New Features: I especially appreciate the enhanced Face ID technology, which works faster and more accurately. The new AI features in the Photos app are a fun addition, making it easier to sort and edit my images.Overall, the iPhone 16 plus is worth every penny. It’s a premium device that stands out for its performance, camera quality, and battery life. If you’re considering an upgrade, the iPhone 16 plus will not disappoint!', 'Excellent Phone. Value for Money.Performance: The phone performs efficiently in most tasks, handling apps and multitasking with ease.Design: The design is sleek and modern, offering a premium look and feel.

If you're thinking of trading in your old phone for a new one, especially online, be warned. It feels like the sellers and delivery agents really try to dodge those exchange deals. For three straight days, they'd show my phone 'out for delivery,' but it would never actually arrive. Then, poof, after 72 hours, it'd get sent back. Can you believe it? That's happened to me twice before!This time, thankfully, I managed to chat with the delivery guy, showed him my old phone (it was in perfect condition, by the way!), and he finally agreed to bring it over the next day. So yeah, my delivery experience? Pretty terrible, honestly. It was such a frustrating, anxious wait.Okay now about the Price and performance:I finally got my hands on the phone, especially for just ₹63,000(with exchange), which was a great deal. I'm totally in love with it! The features are just fantastic, seriously.Let's talk performance – it's just fantastic, no complaints at all there. This phone breezes through everything. I'm talking about super smooth multitasking, zipping through apps. I don't game so don't know about that.The Camera? Mind-Blowingly Amazing!The AI processing is mind-blowing. My photos and videos look stunning, even in tricky lighting. I'm still finding new hidden features in the camera app every single day, which is so cool!Now, the battery. Yeah, it could have been better, I'll admit. But honestly, the phone is so small and compact, I'm totally willing to overlook that. It's just so easy to hold and use! You still get good all-day power if you're not constantly glued to it. The build quality feels really premium too.I'm constantly finding little shortcuts and smart additions that just make using the phone so much better. It's really intuitive and super customizable. Like you can customise literally every look and feel.The Verdict:So, yeah, despite the nightmare getting it delivered, my Samsung S25 has truly blown me away. For ₹63,000(with exchange), it's an absolute steal. The top-notch performance, incredible camera, and its perfect compact size just make it a joy to use every single day. The battery could be better, sure, but honestly, everything else is just so good that I don't even care. I'm genuinely, truly in love with this phone! Couldn't be any better for me!"", ""Phone is good flawless. But the executive which came for pickup old phone deliberately saying phone quality has some issue. He diagnosed phone and nothing was there in software everything thing was on it's place. He said the old phone cost would reduce to 6k. I asked what is the other way. Then he asked 2500 to fix the value. I was no where and have to accept his call. It's very bad. Every setup u will get these type of person. Amazon do something about these creature.Overall phone is flawless no issues after using a month. I love it it's handling"", ""So far, so good. If you're looking for a compact phone with a premium look and performance, you can definitely go for it. Plus, One UI 7 is so good; no issues so far. Battery life is not so great compared to other phones with higher battery, but still good."", 'No doubt the phone is compact and cute, but it is super slippery and the battery lasts  upto 15-16 hrs for a normal usage (kept in the normal mode).

With upgrades like the latest Snapdragon chipset, a revamped cooling system, and a display that’s buttery smooth, this phone is engineered for power users and mobile gamers. After weeks of testing, here’s our take.---### **Key Features Breakdown**1. **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 + LPDDR5X RAM & UFS 4.0 Storage**:The iQOO 13 is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. This combo delivers blistering speeds for multitasking, app launches, and gaming. *Genshin Impact* and *Honkai: Star Rail* run at near-max settings with zero stutters, even during marathon sessions.2. **6.78-inch AMOLED Display (144Hz Refresh Rate)**:The 1.5K AMOLED screen is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery 144Hz refresh rate. HDR10+ support and 3,000 nits peak brightness make outdoor visibility stellar. Gamers will love the 2,000Hz instant touch sampling rate for ultra-responsive controls.3. **Dual Cryo-Vapor Cooling System**:iQOO’s upgraded cooling tech keeps thermals in check during intense gaming. Even after an hour of *PUBG Mobile*, the phone stays comfortably warm—not scalding—with no performance throttling.4. **120W Fast Charging + 5,500mAh Battery**:The 5,500mAh battery lasts a full day of heavy use (6-7 hours screen-on time). When drained, the 120W charger juices it up to 50% in **10 minutes** and 100% in **25 minutes**. Wireless charging is notably absent, though.5. **Triple Camera Setup (50MP + 50MP + 64MP)**:The main 50MP Sony IMX966 sensor captures crisp, dynamic shots in daylight. The 64MP 3x periscope telephoto lens is a standout for sharp zoom (up to 10x hybrid), while low-light performance is decent but not class-leading. The 50MP ultra-wide avoids distortion at the edges.6. **Funtouch OS 14 (Android 14)**:iQOO’s skin is cleaner than before but still includes bloatware. Gaming features like *Monster Mode* (unlocks full CPU/GPU power) and *4D Game Vibration* (haptic feedback synced to in-game actions) add immersion.---### **Performance & Experience**- **Gaming**: This is where the iQOO 13 shines. The combo of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 144Hz display, and touch sampling makes it a mobile gaming beast. Paired with accessories like the iQOO Cooler, it’s a legitimate portable console.- **Daily Use**: Apps fly open, and the UI feels snappy. The flat-edge design offers a premium grip, though the glossy back attracts fingerprints (opt for the vegan leather variant).- **Audio**: Stereo speakers are loud and clear, but audiophiles will miss a headphone jack.---### **Pros vs. Cons****Pros**:✅ Unmatched gaming performance with sustained thermal management.✅ Gorgeous 144Hz AMOLED display with best-in-class touch response.✅ Blazing 120W charging and solid battery life.✅ Versatile camera setup for a performance-focused phone.**Cons**:❌ No wireless charging or IP68 rating (expected at this price).❌ Funtouch OS still feels cluttered compared to stock Android.❌ Bulky at 209g—not ideal for one-handed use.---### **Final Verdict**The iQOO 13 isn’t just a phone; it’s a statement for gamers and power users who refuse to compromise. While it lacks polish in areas like software and premium durability features, its performance, display, and charging speed make it a top contender in the flagship arena.**Who should buy it?**- Mobile gamers craving desktop-level performance.- Users who prioritize charging speed and screen smoothness.- Photography enthusiasts who want a competent camera *and* a powerhouse chipset.**Rating**: 4.3/5 — A near-perfect performance machine held back by minor omissions.*Bottom Line*: If raw power and gaming dominance top your checklist, the iQOO 13 is a thrill ride worth the ticket. For everyone else, wait for a sale or consider more balanced flagships. 🎮⚡', ""Truly amazing smartphone...First I would like to say I'm reviewing after 2 and half month usageFirst I was sceptical about the QC quality issues ..like panel gap and all...but I was gratefully that mine was perfectly fine with no issues...First impressions was very good but not about camera,but beleive me after the second update I did somewhat on April the camera was very outstanding ..the clarity was noticeably improvedThe main thing I buyed this was the performance and it didn't disappointed...The display,battery , performance,camera ,speakers,the call quality ,the charging speed.And the unique feature called monster RGB halo light that makes a attention magnet..and the overall looksEverything is simply amazing ,including additional featuresAnd the con I would like to say is ....1)slightly heating but comes back to normal at the same speed ..it's ok somewhat2) The OS minor bugs that I faced sometime,like stutters when scrolling in YouTube but only for sometime....""]","Camera, Performance & Display",0.3196464646464646,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519PLA1WnuL._SX679_.jpg

The first thing that stands out is the sleek design—it looks and feels like a proper flagship. The in-hand feel is premium, and the matte finish on the back resists fingerprints really well, which is a big plus for everyday use.Performance-wise, it’s incredibly fast. Apps launch instantly, multitasking is seamless, and the high refresh rate makes everything feel super fluid. I’m not a hardcore gamer, but I did try a few graphics-heavy games, and it handled them effortlessly with minimal heat.Sound quality is good and impressive enough.Best for videography as it supports dolby vision shooting till 4k 60 fps and also supports 8k shooting.No issues with regards with connectivity.Battery life has been impressive—I consistently get more than a full day on a single charge, even with moderate to heavy use. The charging speed is mind-blowing. Going from around 10% to full charge in under 30 minutes still surprises me every time.The camera setup is also solid. Daylight photos are sharp and well-detailed, and low-light performance is much better than I expected. The AI scene detection adds a nice touch without making the images look overly processed.Overall, the GT7 Dream Edition feels like a very well-rounded phone. It delivers flagship-level performance, display, and battery without the flagship price tag. If you’re looking for value without compromise, this is a phone worth considering. Super happy with the purchase!', ""Well some reviews about this device were too harsh so I was a bit confused whether to buy it or not . I was initially using a Realme GT Master Edition so  switching from my old phone was very smooth . I will go by department by department ratings of this phone .1. Processor 10/10 : Quite fast at this price point(9400e) , though IQOO Neo 10 is already giving almost that(8s Gen4) at a lower price . For 99% tasks , you won't even need this much amount of processor perf but may help in intensive gaming sessions .2. Battery and Charging 9.5/10 : Battery life is actually very good . A moderate usage will last for around 1.5 days . Charging is also seriously fast , though it will definitely reduce the effective battery capacity in future . Also it is a first gen silicon-carbon battery so maybe there are potential risks as well in future . (You can think of OP 13R since it has Li-ion battery)3. Camera 8/10 : Decent camera , 2x telephoto lens is disappointing in this price point (ik this is kinda gaming focused) . But it clicks good enough pics from primary lens . Camera is not it's USP I'm telling you .4. Software  8.5/10 : It shares the same codebase with Oppo's ColorOS and OnePlus's OxygenOS , so most of the features are common . But just like OnePlus did more overhaul over the base ColorOS , Realme didn't do any such brand specific optimizations . But software is better than FuntouchOS found in Vivo/IQOO devices (I have used them as well) but definitely ranks below OneUI . Animations are fast and customizable as well .5. Other features : LPDDR5X ram works fantastic and UFS 4.0 storage is pretty fast . It has an IR BLASTER which is handy in many cases . Speakers are loud enough . Display is gorgeous as usual in this price range but not sure about the 6000 nits peak brightness maybe a marketing gimmick . Otherwise HBM is good , visible under sunlight , also has an option for Extra brightness in the settings that draws more power.*** P.S. In my unit , I didn't face any heating issues except a little  bit during charging (normal for 120W).  For small gaming sessions like 30-40 mins , it easily handled COD at full graphics settings without noticeable heating . Just after buying this , I got two small software updates in two days .*** May write a long term future review as well"", 'Badiya phone hai, bohot features hai, camera me video shooting ka toh koi competition nahi hai is range me aur photography mein thoda lack karta hai, bgmi gameplay ekdum smooth hai, battery backup thoda kam laga, charging bhi jaldi ho jati hai, iqoo 10 aur poco f7 bhi range par un phone me jo nahi hai vo isme mil jayega, iqoo 10 me ip69 rating nahi hai aur poco ka camera aur heating issue hai par bhai gt7 me sab mil jayega', ""It's a awesome phone I must say....when I have decided to buy a phone with good camera... everyone suggested me to buys samsung or i phone...but as I am realme lover...i have decided to buy this phone...and yes it was very good decision... excellent camera in this price range I must say....i didn't find any heating issue as off now...it's been one month I am using this phone...❣️❣️❣️❣️"", ""Using realme gt7for more than a weak and here is the complete reviewGt 7is Good in terms of display and offers excellent battery very good for gamers I didn't observe any heating issue but yes slightly gets warm if used outside while video recording or prolonged usage but it is not noticeable.battery easily lasts a day for a verage user. Charging speed is excellent charges in 50mins from 0to 100.However the build quality on terms of usage is bulky and we cannot hold the phone for long times need to buy some external case. Cannot hold the phone for long times with a single hand.Coming to ai features I felt more ai features like sketch to image need to be added for gt7 and many other ai features should also be included because at this price point s24fe can offer more ai features.camera is just above average the quality of photos are not up to the mark, telephoto is not at all good when you zoom and take a photo it is not even clear. Disappointed with the camera it is good but not excellent remaining all features are very good. Hope they provide more fixes for camera quality and include more ai features in the coming updates.Pros--Battery-processor-displayCons-camera-design & weight (can't hold for 15mins)bulky not user friendly-less ai features for this price Samsung offers more ai features""]","Camera, Performance & Display",0.1979481792717086,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PTvu-RuQL._SX679_.jpg

And I am absolutely loving it! If you are trying to decide if it is a good phone, it definitely is. OnePlus is offering a 7k exchange bonus till Jan-end, so you can toss away any old working or non-working phone to get a decent discount. With the exchange and Republic Day offers, I got it for around 60K which I feel is a steal. I got the Midnight Ocean variant especially for the textured blue back and it does feel premium.I preferred OP13 over the awesome Samsung S23 ultra mainly because Samsung is not extending the OS updates promise like it did for S24 ultra. Being released this year, OP13 should get at least 4 years of OS updates.DISPLAYThe ProXDR QXD+ LTPO AMOLED display is amazing as expected. In direct sunlight you may need to increase the brightness to near full. The 120Hz refresh rate gives flicker-free screen transitions. Color reproduction is great too. I keep the Always-On display mode that I fell in love with on my previous Pixel. The edge-to-edge display with mildly bent edges and corners offers a lot of real estate. It's a relatively big phone but is not that heavy and can comfortably fit a men's jeans pocket.HARDWAREThe Snapdragon Elite is really snappy! No issues running anything or even many things. I am not a gamer, but have not experienced any heating issues so far. Apart from the 16GB RAM, it adds another virtual 12GB RAM making it a whopping 30GB RAM beast. The half a TB of RAM is almost fully available for shooting hi-res videos or loading big games as the OS and apps occupy less than 50GB of space. It comes with two nano SIM slots. Of course  it supports eSIMs too, but guess you can have only upto two active at a time. Apart from the usual sensors that are standard in most phones nowadays, it comes with a Color temperature sensor, Compass, Ultrasonic fingerprint, Hall sensor, Laser focus sensor, Spectral sensors and Infrared remote control. It also supports the latest standards in most areas - Bluetooth 5.4, WiFi 7, NFC and all GPS systems including NavIC. There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more. Hope the review was helpful."", 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Great features at a fairly reasonable cost.Functionality:Top notch !

It is irritating but you become habitual in a day or two. The Stylus that comes with this phone can be used only with this phone, not elsewhere or any other device. There is no protective case given by Motorola in the box, should have been there. However Motorola did give protective case with moto edge 40 but that too was good for nothing cheap quality TPU case that used last less than a weak. Motorola needs to think over this. Battery backup of should have been more by 500 mAH to make this phone more popular. You need to mandatorily charge this phone at least once a day.

I got bored to android and wanted some change so switched to iPhone. Redmi phones otherwise are awesome too.😊Following are my experiences based on 8 days usage:- Battery backup is very good.Scenario 1:I got 3 days of backup with light usage(picking up the calls, replying whatsapp, 30 minutes of gameplay (genshin impact). For 1 and half days, my phone was on battery saver mode. For the rest of duration it was on normal mode.Scenario 2: Only on normal mode with moderate usage it gives 2 days of backup with light usage.- Performance is awesome. Everything is buttery smooth from apps to games.- Latest ios 17 is good as well. I didnt felt much problems while switching from android to iphone. Many things are improved.- You can remove most of the inbuilt apple apps with ios 17.Things i love about iPhone over android (redmi phones):- flawless performance especially for gaming. No android can offer this level of smoothness.- excellent and all rounder camera.- more battery backup compared to any androidThings i love about android over iPhone:- android is more flexible than ios. e.g you can’t select all emails in gmail app in iphone. You cant close all background running apps in one shot like we do it in android.- apps are way better in terms of usability.- i personally found that ios has more bugs than android ( which can be felt by a common user). E.g. keyboard sound suddenly increases, not able to receive a call sometimes. Apple do resolve these in their updates but for a phone which costs this much it’s embarrassing.- cheap cost compared to iphone. People usually go for iphone when they get bored from android (my case) or to be a status symbol or who needs reliable phone for long run. But the things have changed now. Even android offers long term support now and they are bit cheaper compared to iphone giving you more features and usability.Final verdict: iphone is allrounder phone in my opinion. Great camera, great performance, great battery life, great cost too😁. So if you need a change definitely go for it. Its a great phone.', ""Go for it.

No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\'s cameras can do.- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you\'d want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to ""smart"" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn\'t have all of it, to which I\'ll come in ""CONS"" section.- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.- Build quality and software are really premium, you\'ll know you\'ve sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.CONS:- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you\'ve used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!- Another issue with curved screen, since there\'s a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don\'t fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn\'t make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ₹1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn\'t look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn\'t come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There\'s no Good Lock module to have app lock either.- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn\'t give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.- Overall this is a really good phone, best I\'d say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should\'ve been implemented.- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation.', 'Dropping the review after using for 7 months, working perfectly...truly a flagship phone... worked good to click photos in rain, IP68 rating works good. Camera is loved by all of my friends.', 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Samsung Trust', 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:RumoursTouch quality:Veryyy goodValue for money:Quite expensive not worth buyingGot easily broken guzs', ""I had switched to the S23 Ultra from the iPhone 13. For me, the S23 Ultra is in a different league compared to the iPhone 13. The cameras are so much better and the telephoto lens of the phone also adds an interesting and useful component to the phone. even when gaming, it gives me 120 fps in most of the games. the display is fantastic and even the charging is adequately fast and reliable. (you need to buy the 45w charger separately.) apart from that, the speakers are fantastic and the haptic feedback is great too. The only major downside I found is that it heats a little bit while you play heavy games and the phone charges slowly while being used. overall, if you can get this phone below 85k now, definitely go for it as it almost has no difference compared to the S24 ultra. The battery backup is also great and 1.5 charging cycles lasts me the entire day. (my average SOT is 10-14 hours). The S pen is also quite handy and is useful occasionally. I would say this is the best all-rounder Android phone you can get if you're looking for a phone below the 100k barrier. Also, the phone will get updates till Android 17 so there is no worry of the OS falling back in time and will run you a good 3 years even if you buy the phone now. Remember that the phone is huge and only buy it if you're comfortable with this form factor or this phone may render as useless to you. go for the regular s23 models if you're not a hardcore user but if you have the budget and requiremnts of the features in this phone i would 100% recommend this phone to you."", 'Love this phone.Although not very sleek, but the spen is an added boon, which helps in easing many tasks.Battery performance is very satisfactory, can handle multiple apps together without getting hanged or heating up', 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Legend 🙏Software quality:The best software', 'Nice product', 'كنت مقلق فى الاول من الشراء اونلاين لكن الحمد لله جاء سليم وأصلي والتوصيل راقي', 'افضل تاني هاتف في العالم بعد s24 الترا', 'Sealed and new 👌']",Daily Usage & Quality Concerns,0.1741552643784786,Positive,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lD7eGdW-L._SX679_.jpg

The in-hand feel is premium, and the matte finish on the back resists fingerprints really well, which is a big plus for everyday use.Performance-wise, it’s incredibly fast. Apps launch instantly, multitasking is seamless, and the high refresh rate makes everything feel super fluid. I’m not a hardcore gamer, but I did try a few graphics-heavy games, and it handled them effortlessly with minimal heat.Sound quality is good and impressive enough.Best for videography as it supports dolby vision shooting till 4k 60 fps and also supports 8k shooting.No issues with regards with connectivity.Battery life has been impressive—I consistently get more than a full day on a single charge, even with moderate to heavy use. The charging speed is mind-blowing. Going from around 10% to full charge in under 30 minutes still surprises me every time.The camera setup is also solid. Daylight photos are sharp and well-detailed, and low-light performance is much better than I expected. The AI scene detection adds a nice touch without making the images look overly processed.Overall, the GT7 Dream Edition feels like a very well-rounded phone. It delivers flagship-level performance, display, and battery without the flagship price tag. If you’re looking for value without compromise, this is a phone worth considering. Super happy with the purchase!', ""Well some reviews about this device were too harsh so I was a bit confused whether to buy it or not . I was initially using a Realme GT Master Edition so  switching from my old phone was very smooth . I will go by department by department ratings of this phone .1. Processor 10/10 : Quite fast at this price point(9400e) , though IQOO Neo 10 is already giving almost that(8s Gen4) at a lower price . For 99% tasks , you won't even need this much amount of processor perf but may help in intensive gaming sessions .2. Battery and Charging 9.5/10 : Battery life is actually very good . A moderate usage will last for around 1.5 days . Charging is also seriously fast , though it will definitely reduce the effective battery capacity in future . Also it is a first gen silicon-carbon battery so maybe there are potential risks as well in future . (You can think of OP 13R since it has Li-ion battery)3. Camera 8/10 : Decent camera , 2x telephoto lens is disappointing in this price point (ik this is kinda gaming focused) . But it clicks good enough pics from primary lens . Camera is not it's USP I'm telling you .4. Software  8.5/10 : It shares the same codebase with Oppo's ColorOS and OnePlus's OxygenOS , so most of the features are common . But just like OnePlus did more overhaul over the base ColorOS , Realme didn't do any such brand specific optimizations . But software is better than FuntouchOS found in Vivo/IQOO devices (I have used them as well) but definitely ranks below OneUI . Animations are fast and customizable as well .5. Other features : LPDDR5X ram works fantastic and UFS 4.0 storage is pretty fast . It has an IR BLASTER which is handy in many cases . Speakers are loud enough . Display is gorgeous as usual in this price range but not sure about the 6000 nits peak brightness maybe a marketing gimmick . Otherwise HBM is good , visible under sunlight , also has an option for Extra brightness in the settings that draws more power.*** P.S. In my unit , I didn't face any heating issues except a little  bit during charging (normal for 120W).  For small gaming sessions like 30-40 mins , it easily handled COD at full graphics settings without noticeable heating . Just after buying this , I got two small software updates in two days .*** May write a long term future review as well"", 'Badiya phone hai, bohot features hai, camera me video shooting ka toh koi competition nahi hai is range me aur photography mein thoda lack karta hai, bgmi gameplay ekdum smooth hai, battery backup thoda kam laga, charging bhi jaldi ho jati hai, iqoo 10 aur poco f7 bhi range par un phone me jo nahi hai vo isme mil jayega, iqoo 10 me ip69 rating nahi hai aur poco ka camera aur heating issue hai par bhai gt7 me sab mil jayega', ""It's a awesome phone I must say....when I have decided to buy a phone with good camera... everyone suggested me to buys samsung or i phone...but as I am realme lover...i have decided to buy this phone...and yes it was very good decision... excellent camera in this price range I must say....i didn't find any heating issue as off now...it's been one month I am using this phone...❣️❣️❣️❣️"", ""Using realme gt7for more than a weak and here is the complete reviewGt 7is Good in terms of display and offers excellent battery very good for gamers I didn't observe any heating issue but yes slightly gets warm if used outside while video recording or prolonged usage but it is not noticeable.battery easily lasts a day for a verage user. Charging speed is excellent charges in 50mins from 0to 100.However the build quality on terms of usage is bulky and we cannot hold the phone for long times need to buy some external case. Cannot hold the phone for long times with a single hand.Coming to ai features I felt more ai features like sketch to image need to be added for gt7 and many other ai features should also be included because at this price point s24fe can offer more ai features.camera is just above average the quality of photos are not up to the mark, telephoto is not at all good when you zoom and take a photo it is not even clear. Disappointed with the camera it is good but not excellent remaining all features are very good.

The screen recorder also doesn't work. Had a connection with motorola but this mobile shatters that trust. Have no other option with this mobile. Waste of money and effort. Extremely dissatisfied."", 'ok', 'Pros: Lightweight, Almost clean interface, good network reception because of the SAR value 1, good build quality and aesthetics, availability of 3.5 mm audio jack, flat display, motorola smart connect feature to easily integrate with your pc., sd card can be used to extend storage, RAM can be extended using internal memory space.Cons: couple of apps comes pre-installed and can be removed easily but Motorola should avoid this otherwise the key differentiator of Motorola will be gone. UI is little buggy typically with the Search field in the App tray. It works only when Moto AI feature is enabled, and that too needs improvement. It is irritating but you become habitual in a day or two. The Stylus that comes with this phone can be used only with this phone, not elsewhere or any other device. There is no protective case given by Motorola in the box, should have been there. However Motorola did give protective case with moto edge 40 but that too was good for nothing cheap quality TPU case that used last less than a weak. Motorola needs to think over this. Battery backup of should have been more by 500 mAH to make this phone more popular. You need to mandatorily charge this phone at least once a day. Not a big deal but no room for being careless about charging, that you can become with other phone models in this price range. Price of this phone should have been around  20-21K, eventually it will fall much below this. But lesser introduction price could have been better. The phone is not for gamers so gamers look for some other phone. It is good phone for normal users though. Motorola has launched Moto Edge 60 Stylus and Moto G Stylus almost simultaneously with just the difference in the processor, and this is beyond any logic as neither processor is latest.', ""I will write a detailed review later.

So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE.

The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞"", ""I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience."", ""Everything is on point as expected. But there are 1 or 2 things i want to share.1. Metal edges are little bit on sharp side so without cover it is difficult to use.2. If you live in warm area, it really gets hot and i found frame skips, but that was one time in 1 year of use.3.

Here's an overview of its highlights and areas where it falls short:### **Positives**1. **Stunning Display**: The 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is a visual treat with vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It performs exceptionally well even under direct sunlight.2. **Solid Build Quality**: With an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the phone feels sturdy yet premium. It's also IP68-certified for water and dust resistance.3. **Top-notch Performance**: Powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, the S24+ delivers seamless multitasking and gaming experiences. Apps load quickly, and heavy games run without any noticeable lag.4. **Impressive Camera System**: The triple-camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Photos are sharp, well-detailed, and dynamic, even in low-light conditions. The AI enhancements add a professional touch to your pictures.5. **Battery Life**: The 4900mAh battery easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use, and the 45W fast charging ensures you’re back in action quickly.6. **Software Experience**: One UI 6.1 is polished and intuitive, offering a plethora of customization options and thoughtful features like DeX mode for productivity enthusiasts.### **Negatives**1. **Price Point**: At its premium price, the S24+ competes with other flagship devices that offer similar or slightly better features, making it a tough sell for budget-conscious users.2. **Limited Optical Zoom**: The 3x optical zoom feels underwhelming compared to competitors like the Google Pixel 8 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro, which offer higher zoom capabilities.3. **No MicroSD Slot**: Samsung has once again omitted the microSD card slot, which might disappoint users who rely on expandable storage.4. **Bloatware**: Despite being a flagship, the S24+ comes pre-installed with unnecessary apps that detract from the otherwise premium experience.5. **Charging Brick Not Included**: Following industry trends, Samsung does not include a charging brick in the box, which can be inconvenient for those without a compatible charger.The Samsung Galaxy S24+ is a fantastic all-rounder that excels in design, performance, and camera capabilities. While it has a few shortcomings, they are relatively minor compared to its overall excellence. If you're looking for a reliable flagship phone and are willing to overlook the absence of a few features, the Galaxy S24+ is worth considering."", ""It's decent but suffers from some overall slowness and lag after launching apps, mild freezes sometimes, and slowness while sending youtube, facebook, insta links on whatsapp take long to show up. Other apps also render very slowly. Not sure if this is a Samsung One UI issue but this happens with almost every apps and it's Allah more noticeable as I switched over from IPhone XS."", ""After using it for two months,  excellent phone. Camera quality good. Front camera bit ok. Rear camera awesome. Weight not much , doesn't feel heavy without cover. Absolute worthy for money. Design good."", ""I bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time I was quite scared that the same thing will happen again. And sadly, my fears were right. The first thing I did was compare internet speed with my other phone and the speed was less than half of what was in other phone. These two times can't be a coincidence. I tried everything to accont for any error. I even exchanged the SIMs even though both were Jio, so that I am 100% sure.There is definitely some problem with exynos processor and internet speeds but I didn't know the drop would be less than half of what others are giving.Also there are genuine heating issues. Even for day to day task it would heat up. I knew about heating issues in Exynos but thought it was a premium flagship phone and my usage is quite light so it wouldn't make a difference. But, it did make a difference. Even on a 5-10 minues call it would heat up and become uncomfortable.Really feel cheated out of my money this time. I guess there is a reason they don't sell exynos in USA and China. Also there is  reason there was no exynos in S23 series and neither it is in S25.Once you buy the product can only be replaced and not returned, so you will be stuck with a smartphone where the most basic and the most critical function of a stable and fast internet itself is not there. Plus heating issues even on basic tasks will lead to throttling and slowing down ruining your experience.It is definitely not worth the money even on a huge discount which would be coming as I don't think otherwise anybody would buy it.The whole purpose of me writing this review (I generally don't review products) is to feel at least some sense of comfort that somebody else may not lose his/her money like I did, reading my review.If you want Samsung only - go for S23 series or S25 or S24 ultra but at all cost avoid Exynos processor. They are definitely, with multiple, and over the years, empirical evidence have significantly (not just slightly) poor and unstable internet speeds and really bad heating problems and it doesn't matter what is the pattern of your usage and these reviewers on youtube dont' tell us that.My Speed Test Data: On Snapdragon with Jio5G - Upto 140, always 100 Mbps + ; On Exynos with same SIM - Max 30-40 and on average 20-30, but the catch it is very unstable so a lot of time below 10 and even below 1.AVOID EXYNOS.

And I am absolutely loving it! If you are trying to decide if it is a good phone, it definitely is. OnePlus is offering a 7k exchange bonus till Jan-end, so you can toss away any old working or non-working phone to get a decent discount. With the exchange and Republic Day offers, I got it for around 60K which I feel is a steal. I got the Midnight Ocean variant especially for the textured blue back and it does feel premium.I preferred OP13 over the awesome Samsung S23 ultra mainly because Samsung is not extending the OS updates promise like it did for S24 ultra. Being released this year, OP13 should get at least 4 years of OS updates.DISPLAYThe ProXDR QXD+ LTPO AMOLED display is amazing as expected. In direct sunlight you may need to increase the brightness to near full. The 120Hz refresh rate gives flicker-free screen transitions. Color reproduction is great too. I keep the Always-On display mode that I fell in love with on my previous Pixel. The edge-to-edge display with mildly bent edges and corners offers a lot of real estate. It's a relatively big phone but is not that heavy and can comfortably fit a men's jeans pocket.HARDWAREThe Snapdragon Elite is really snappy! No issues running anything or even many things. I am not a gamer, but have not experienced any heating issues so far. Apart from the 16GB RAM, it adds another virtual 12GB RAM making it a whopping 30GB RAM beast. The half a TB of RAM is almost fully available for shooting hi-res videos or loading big games as the OS and apps occupy less than 50GB of space. It comes with two nano SIM slots. Of course  it supports eSIMs too, but guess you can have only upto two active at a time. Apart from the usual sensors that are standard in most phones nowadays, it comes with a Color temperature sensor, Compass, Ultrasonic fingerprint, Hall sensor, Laser focus sensor, Spectral sensors and Infrared remote control. It also supports the latest standards in most areas - Bluetooth 5.4, WiFi 7, NFC and all GPS systems including NavIC. There is no SD card slot but as the base model itself comes with 256GB, it should be more than enough for most people.SOFTWAREOne of the reasons I preferred Pixel phones was the no-bloat OS. The OxygenOS in OP15, brings all the goodies of Android 15 with hardly any bloatware and also adds some extra features and customizability. Currently, OnePlus is offering 4 OS updates and hopefully they will provide even more. There are some helpful utility apps added by OnePlus like a customizable shortcuts bar, customizable icons, audio recorders etc. Further, features like split screen, hand gestures and even face gestures are available, some probably coming from Android 15.CAMERAThe camera is awesome. Photos of day-to-day things look like professional photos. The night photos look wonderful as well. Though the built-in zoom is only 3X, it allows you to zoom in upto a mindboggling 120x! See attached photo. At such zooms you will need a tripod. The photos at big zooms will have more AI corrections but is still mostly acceptable. The 8K video capability, 480fps slo-mo etc. promises a good video experience. The portrait mode offers amazing portrait shots equivalent to Hasselblad camera lenses. The portrait mode is restricted to 3X. The camera supports live photo (moving photos), timer, palm gesture to take photos, AI enhancements etc.BATTERYThe battery with the newer Silicon NanoStack technology lives up to its reputation. It is supposed to be safer with less heating issues. Even with location on, the battery drains very slowly. I feel it can last 2 days or more with light usage. Had taken it out peak noon with brightness set to near 100%. This drained the battery faster but still had about 30% left at the end of the day. Also the bundled 100W charger can charge it up in under 40 mins. The battery, in spite of the 6000Mah capacity, is lighter than the one in OP12. It did not heat up in regular indoor use. The above noon outdoor photography along with the high outside temperature, did heat up the phone. Good thing is that it didn't seem to affect the photography. My Pixel used to refuse to use camera or upload photos to Google Photos if the phone is hot. OP13 cooled down quickly as well.SOUNDHad no issues with calls. The speakers are loud and clear as well.FINGERPRINTThe ultrasonic fingerprint is touted to be better because it can read even with wet hands or gloves. I haven't tried these use cases, but as far as normal recognition goes, it looks comparable to other fingerprint readers. At times, it misses recognising too. But, in general, the unlocking is ultra quick, thanks also to the superior hardware specs and bloat-free OS.ACCESSORIESIt comes bundled with a 100W SuperVOOC charger and a decent rubbery back case. While OP13 supports 50W wireless charging, but to use MagSafe chargers, you need to get a MagSafe compatible charging cases. I got such a case from OnePlus that had the MagSafe feature for 2K.SUMMARYIf you are ok for the price range, you can absolutely go for the OP13. I have used the phone for about a week. Will update more details and camera photos as I use it more. Hope the review was helpful."", 'Why did you pick this product vs others?:Great features at a fairly reasonable cost.Functionality:Top notch !

The moment he saw it, he was blown away by the design—it’s so different from the usual phones flooding the market. The Nothing Phone truly has its own identity, especially with that eye-catching Glyph backlighting system. Those LED strips on the back light up in cool patterns, and it’s something you won’t find anywhere else. It’s safe to say this phone has carved out its own unique spot in the smartphone world.Performance-wise, the phone runs smoothly and handles light gaming like a champ, thanks to its MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro processor and Mali-G610 GPU. My nephew enjoys playing his favorite games, and it keeps up without any hiccups. What I really appreciate, though, is the Nothing OS system UI. It’s perfectly designed with a unique grayscale display that’s not as flashy or colorful as other Android interfaces. This subtle touch seems intentional—it doesn’t pull you in to overuse the phone, which is great for my nephew. It’s refreshing to see a company like Nothing think about how design can influence usage habits in a positive way.The camera, I’ll admit, is a bit disappointing. It’s got a dual 50MP setup on the back and a 32MP front camera, but the quality isn’t top-tier. That said, my nephew doesn’t mind one bit—he’s just snapping pics of his toys and random stuff around the house, so it’s more than good enough for him. If you’re a photography buff, this might not be your pick, but for casual use, it gets the job done.Overall, I’m thrilled with this purchase! The Nothing Phone 2a 5G brings a fresh vibe with its standout design and thoughtful features. The package even came with a unique Type-C charging cable with transparent connectors—such a cool touch—and a sleek, matching SIM ejector that my nephew thought was “super fancy.” The only downside?

Descent camera2. Good looking and unique design3. Stereo speakers with descent and loud sound4. Lag free and clean UI5. Excellent haptic feedback in this price range6. 5000mah battery (gives approx 7 hours of screen on time)7. Display is good but peak brightness is low I mean it should be atleast 2000nits8. Descent Processor it can handle all the basic tasks and some casually gaming of 2-3hrs easily9. Comes with pre applied screen protector (Phone1 and Phone2 didn't came with pre applied)Cons:1. Personally I don't like the polycarbonate back there are many phones in this price range which comes with glass back (but the back feels like the glass they have done a great job although it scratches easily)2. Issue with other brands fast chargers ( I had nothing phone 1 and I used to charge it with mi 33w charger and it support fast charging but nothing phone 2a does not support qc charging technology now I'll have to buy a pd charger)3.

Highly recommended!', ""I am writing this review after using the iPhone 16 Plus for three months. First, the box arrived in terrible condition, making me worried about the phone inside.  Thankfully, the phone itself was in perfect condition. Display: The display is very good, with nice viewing angles, but the Dynamic Island can be a little distracting when watching movies or other content.  The brightness is good, bright enough for outdoor use.Design: The design is great; it feels comfortable in hand, with nice curves around the edges. The matte finish on the back prevents fingerprints.  It also doesn't feel too heavy.Camera: The camera is good. Daylight photos are sharp with natural colors, but when zoomed in, the details aren't as good as other phones in the same price range.  While other phones retain some detail when zoomed, the 16 Plus's images look blurry. However, it has nice features like Photographic Styles and Audio Mix, which are very useful.  iPhones are known for their video quality, and the 16 Plus doesn't disappoint. Videos are excellent, with top-notch quality, great detail, dynamic range, and natural-looking colors. Portraits also look very good.Battery: The battery life is fantastic. I previously used a OnePlus 8, which had terrible battery life, barely lasting four hours.  The 16 Plus is a huge improvement. As a heavy user, I'm very satisfied. With moderate use, the battery lasts me until the next day. With heavy use (gaming, movies, YouTube), I need to charge it at night. The only disappointment with iPhones is the charging speed, which feels slow compared to Android phones. Fast charging only goes up to 45 watts, especially when playing games or doing other demanding tasks while charging.Performance: Performance is top-notch. The A18 chip is very powerful and handles heavy tasks easily. I experienced no lags or frame drops while gaming.Software: iOS 18 is very good in terms of customization. Apple has finally added features that have been available on Android for years, like app lock and the ability to hide apps. However, Apple's AI features aren't that impressive or exciting. While the Siri integration with ChatGPT is good and useful, and the writing tools are helpful, I feel Apple should introduce more AI features, like Samsung, which are more useful and exciting.Overall, I feel the iPhone 16 Plus is great for daily use. It has very good performance, great battery life, and good cameras. Its shortcomings are the lack of a ProMotion 120Hz display. Apple should have at least provided 90Hz for a phone costing 90K and the absence of a telephoto camera. For first-time iPhone buyers, the 16 Plus is a great choice, but for those looking to upgrade, it might not be worth it right now."", 'Amazing product....Will update after few months of use', 'I recently upgraded to the iPhone 16 plus, and I’m absolutely thrilled with it! Apple has really outdone itself with this model, bringing several new features that make a noticeable difference in daily use.Design and Display: The design is sleek and modern, with an edge-to-edge display that feels immersive. The new screen technology makes everything look vibrant and sharp, even under direct sunlight.Camera: The camera system is fantastic. The improved low-light performance and new image stabilization features have allowed me to capture stunning, professional-quality photos.The high-resolution front camera is perfect for video calls and selfies. Apple has clearly focused on making the iPhone 16 plus a go-to device for photography enthusiasts.Battery Life: Battery life has improved significantly. I can easily go a full day on a single charge with moderate use, and the fast-charging feature is a life-saver when I’m in a rush.Performance: Powered by Apple’s latest chipset, the iPhone 16 plus is incredibly fast and responsive. Whether I’m multitasking between apps or playing graphics-heavy games, it never lags. The new iOS version runs flawlessly, offering a smooth, intuitive user experience.New Features: I especially appreciate the enhanced Face ID technology, which works faster and more accurately. The new AI features in the Photos app are a fun addition, making it easier to sort and edit my images.Overall, the iPhone 16 plus is worth every penny. It’s a premium device that stands out for its performance, camera quality, and battery life. If you’re considering an upgrade, the iPhone 16 plus will not disappoint!', 'Excellent Phone. Value for Money.Performance: The phone performs efficiently in most tasks, handling apps and multitasking with ease.Design: The design is sleek and modern, offering a premium look and feel.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust.

There are more pros in device than cons and I must say no other phone can beat this in this particular price segment.Design and Build (9/10)-The phone feels quite sleek and comfortable in hand. Weighing just about 180g and about 7.5mm thick. This phone is by far the slimmest and lightest 5500Mah phone I have ever seen. Even slimmer and slighter than many 5000Mah phone is the market. Ther design language is taken from newly launched Vivo v40 series and this phone is exact replica or little toned down version of Vivo V40e. So you are getting a 28k V40e phone under 20k. A sweet deal right.Display(8.5/10) -- The display is a typical 120Hz, Oled panel with deep black and around 1000 nits of peak brightness which is more than enough in outdoor environment. Colours are punchy and crisp. You get different colour modes which you can set as per your taste.Camera (9/10)-  Camera is just outstanding. I have never seen such an amazing low light performance from any 15-20k phones in the recent times. The camera balances light very well and even in backlite situation the photos are amazing. The 2x potraits are awesome coupled with various background bokeh modes. Colours are good and dynamic range is fantastic. This phone is camera beast in 18k and I must say Well done Iqoo. They focused on giving 1 very good camera rather than two or three average cameras. Many brands give useless 8MP wide angle camera and mediocre primary camera in this range. If wide angle is your priority than you can go with Iqoo z9s pro model.Performance(9/10)--This phone can handle days to day task very smoothly with no zitter or lag. Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.Battery (10/10)--Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.Software and other features (7/10)--The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added."", 'First time I purchase iqoo z9s mobile to be honest I m very happy for everything in this mobile every feature is so cool and comfortable and also looks very beautiful and stunning, very slim and very much pretty...5g runs very well, camera quality is superb❤️❤️❤️💯perfact for everyone who want to purchase this mobile...Mera to best ever phone hai ye 🥰😍', 'Hello.

Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.Software and other features (7/10)--The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added."", 'First time I purchase iqoo z9s mobile to be honest I m very happy for everything in this mobile every feature is so cool and comfortable and also looks very beautiful and stunning, very slim and very much pretty...5g runs very well, camera quality is superb❤️❤️❤️💯perfact for everyone who want to purchase this mobile...Mera to best ever phone hai ye 🥰😍', 'Hello.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.', 'Phone features are aside, the best thing is One Plus give always the complete package.
